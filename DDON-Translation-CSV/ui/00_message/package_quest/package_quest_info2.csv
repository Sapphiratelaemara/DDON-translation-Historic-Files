","The Liberation Army succeeded in retaking Lookout Castle. 
However, the remnants of the Demon Army escaped into the outer defense zone of the castle and continue to hold their ground. 
It was believed that the Liberation Army could not possibly reclaim the castle as they could not allocate sufficient forces for its defense. However, there is one person who can break through such a situation. 
A genius staff officer named Sonel, who is a member of the Liberation Army. 
The Arisen who played a significant role in the recapture of Lookout Castle will join him in the ""impossible recapture mission.""
