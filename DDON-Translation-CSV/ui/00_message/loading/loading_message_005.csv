"険しい渓谷にしがみつくように残された小村
かつて、ドリード城主が健在だった時代は賑わって
いたが、北部オーク軍の動きが活発化した頃から
強力な魔物の襲撃もあり、徐々に人が離れた
しかし、景観や古城に魅せられる探訪者は多い","Nestled in a treacherous ravine, a small village remains clinging on.
Once thriving in the days when Lord Dreed ruled, it gradually lost its inhabitants as the movements of the Northern Orc army intensified. Nevertheless, many visitors are still enchanted by the scenery and the ancient Dreed Castle."
"平原と山岳地帯の中ほどに位置する大渓谷
渓流と針葉樹林の茂る美しい景観が最大の魅力
自然だけではなく、旧白騎団の古城、見張り塔
など遺構も数多く存在し、かつてここが繁栄の地で
あった事を偲ばせる","A large valley located in the middle of a plain and mountainous region.
The most significant charm of this place lies in its beautiful landscape with flowing streams and lush coniferous forests. It's not only the natural beauty but also the numerous remnants of the old White Knights' castle, watchtowers, and other structures that evoke memories of the past prosperity of this area."
"ダウ渓谷にそびえ立つ古城廃墟
３００年前は騎士団長が城主を務めレスタニアの
守りを担っていたが、白竜が墜ちた後に捨てられ
今に至る。内部には住みついた魔物だけでなく
旧時代の遺物も多く残されているらしい","Standing tall in the Dowe Valley is the ancient castle ruin.
300 years ago, it was the stronghold of the knight commander who protected Lestania.
However, it was abandoned after the fall of the White Dragon, and it remains deserted to this day. 
Inside, not only are there lurking demons, but also numerous relics from the past era are said to be preserved."
"レスタニアには地下墓地が多く存在する
元は魔物や病により命を落とした者を清め、大地に
還すため造られたものだったが、不幸にも白竜の
力が衰えたことで瘴気が増し、不死者の巣窟と
化してしまった","Lestania has many underground tombs.
Originally, they were created to cleanse those who had lost their lives due to monsters and disease, returning them to the earth.
Unfortunately, due to the decline in the power of the White Dragon, the miasma increased and the tombs turned into a nest of the undead."
"旧時代、レスタニアでは水の制御技術が現在より
発達していた。禊の神殿に代表されるような治水術
は今や失われ、旧水路のほとんどは湿気と汚水
魔物の溜まり場となっている","In the old days, water control technology in Lestania was more advanced than it is now. Flood control techniques, such as the Temple of Purification, have been lost, and most of the old waterways have become gathering places for moisture, sewage, and monsters."
"ドリード城内、《地下通用口》から繋がる水路
もとはドリード城と河川の運搬路を繋ぐ連絡路
であったようだが、城の牢で獄死した者の骨や
入りこんだ魔物、瘴気が溜まり本来の機能は
失われて久しい","An underground waterway connected to the ""Underground Side Entrance"" within Dreed Castle.
Originally, it served as a passage linking the castle and the river for transportation purposes. However, it has long lost its original function due to the accumulation of bones of those who died in the castle's prison, as well as the presence of invading monsters and miasma."
