"危ない所だった――
ただでさえ怪力で厄介なサイクロプスが
侵食によって、およそ生物とは
思えない力を発揮していた","It was a dangerous place...
Even a simple Cyclops, already troublesome due to its sturdiness,
was demonstrating an unexpected strength when corrupted by these strange
organisms."
"まともに相手をしていたら、今頃命は無かっただろう
今こうして日記を書いている手も、震えが止まらない","If I did not have a decent partner, I would not currently be alive.
Even as I write this, my hands cannot stop trembling."
"なんとか手に入れたこのおぞましい貴重素材――
見た目はひどいものだが、
祈祷師や好事家あたりが見れば大喜びするだろう","I did manage to acquire this valuable and hideous material somehow...
Although it's a terrible sight to behold, you would be delighted to see the prices the
shamans and dilettantes have offered for it."
"しかし、金にするのが本当に正しい用途なのか？
もっと集めることで、何か作り出せるのかもしれない","But, is this really the right way to use it; making money?
Perhaps by gathering more, something useful might be made from it."
"例えば、それが武器だとしたら――
大きな力を持つはずだ","For example, if formed into a weapon...it should be imbued with great power."
