old,new
“筆跡が新しい日記のページが落ちている”,"""The handwriting is from a page that has fallen out of a new diary."""
"数多の魔物を打ち倒し、
実力をつけていく手応えは確かに感じていた――
だからこそ、慢心があったのかもしれない","I certainly felt the way to put my skills to the test,
was to defeat a multitude of monsters...
Perhaps I was too overconfident in my ability."
"先の戦いで手負いだとしても、油断があったとしても
こうも簡単に囲まれるとは情けない――","Even if you purposely throw the previous battle, and even if you
were unprepared, it is pitiful to be surrounded as easily as this..."
"暗闇の先から、盗賊たちの息遣いが聞こえる
この緊張を破るきっかけがあれば、
飢えた狼のように一斉に飛びかかる気なのだろう","From the darkness, you can hear the thieves breathing as
they wait for a chance to break the tension in the air.
Perhaps they're going to jump out and strike in unison like starving wolves."
"全てを塔に置いてきたことだけが、唯一の救いだ
あの妖しき宝は、盗賊ごときに渡すのは惜しいからな","Putting everything into the tower, may prove to be my salvation.
That bewitching treasure, it would be regrettable to hand it over to someone such as a thief."
"“良くない運命”
――あぁ、音も無く忍び寄られていたのか","""Bad fate""
...Aah, have you been creeping up on me without a sound?"
