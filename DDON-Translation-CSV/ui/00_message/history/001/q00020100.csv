"HISTORY_STEP_97","　治療のために神殿で過ごすことになったロイグの病
気は赤色病だった

　古くに根絶された病ゆえ薬の調達に多少手間がかか
ったが、覚者たちの献身により入手済みだ。ロイグは
ほどなく健康を取り戻すことだろう

　フィンダムから来たふたりが言葉を交わす機会が格
段に増えるわけであるから、セシリーの記憶が戻る可
能性も大いに高まるに違いない","Loeg, who had to spend time in the temple for treatment, was suffering from Red Blight.

Although it took some effort to procure medicine for this disease that had been eradicated long ago, it had already been obtained thanks to the dedication of the Arisen. Loeg would soon regain his health.

Since the two who came from Phindym would have more opportunities to converse, it is highly likely that Cecily's memories will also return."
