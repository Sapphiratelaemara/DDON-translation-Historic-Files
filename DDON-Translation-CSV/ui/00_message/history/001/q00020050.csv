Furthermore, Leo, who had been out of contact for a long time, appeared and informed that he is protecting a man named Loeg who came from Phindym.

If Cecily and Loeg are introduced to each other, there is a high possibility of obtaining the information we desire. However, Leo's intentions also greatly concern us."
