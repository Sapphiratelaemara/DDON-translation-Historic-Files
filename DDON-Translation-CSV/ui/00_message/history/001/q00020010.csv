アの危機に繋がる懸念である","In a single night, a storm left deep wounds in various parts of Lestania, affecting the people. The White Dragon has no memory of such a calamity before. The full extent of the damage is still unknown, but we hope for the White Dragon's protection for the devastated citizens.

Now, before summarizing the report on the damages, let me write about the incident that occurred at Breya Coast. A carcass of a monster washed ashore, but its identity was unknown, so Arisen were dispatched for investigation.

While the Arisen were examining the carcass, they discovered a young girl who had collapsed. They attempted to confirm whether she was alive or not, but the next moment, they found themselves in an unfamiliar land.

In that land, the Arisen were attacked by a knight in black armor, putting them in a desperate situation. However, they were luckily rescued and returned safely thanks to the assistance of the White Dragon's power.

The girl is currently being protected in the temple, but she has yet to regain consciousness. We hope for her speedy recovery.

Furthermore, the Arisen also witnessed a similar monster, possibly connected to the carcass on the coast, in a mysterious land. This is another concern that may lead to a crisis in Lestania."
