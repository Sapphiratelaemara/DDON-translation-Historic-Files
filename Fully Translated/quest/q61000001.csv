"ちょうどお前に話したいことが――
――いや、戦況については
ジョゼフから聞いているぞ","There's something I wanted to talk to you about...
Actually, I've already heard about
the situation on the battlefield from Joseph.","","Craig"
"それを踏まえた上で
オレからも伝えたいことがある
“竜の力を帯びた武具”について、だ","With that in mind, 
I found some interesting information. 
It’s about ""equipment imbued with dragon's power.""","","Craig"
"“竜の力を帯びた武具”
――“竜武具”を鍛える方法について
ずいぶん調べてみた
お前にも、わかったことを話しておきたい","""Equipment imbued with dragon's power""...
I've done quite a bit of research on how
to forge these ""Dragon Arms."" 
I want to share what I’ve discovered with you.","","Craig"
"まずは強化だが――
これについては、オレよりもソニアが詳しい
詳しい者に任せた方がいいだろう","First, about enhancements...
Sonia knows a bit more than I do about this.
Better to leave it to the expert.","","Craig"
"なに、ソニアは良いポーンだ
多少複雑な武具だろうと
これまで通り上手くやってくれるはずだ","Indeed, Sonia is a reliable pawn.
Regardless of how intricate
the gear might be, she’ll
manage it with no issue.","","Craig"
"次に、強化に使う素材だ
武具を手に入れた場所には、武具と同じように
竜の力を帯びた素材があるはずだ
こいつを集めればいい","Next, materials for enhancement.
Where you found the arms, there
should be materials imbued with
dragon's power, just like them.
Gather them.","","Craig"
"素材を集めるには、もうひとつ方法がある
それが“資源分解”だ――
竜の力を帯びた武具が余っていたら
オレのところに持ってきてくれ","There's another way to procure
materials - ""Equipment Disassembly"".
If you have spare arms imbued
with dragon's power, bring them to me.","","Craig"
"そいつを分解して素材に変えてやることができる
少々荒っぽいが、多少は負担が減るはずだ","I can break it down and turn it into materials.
It may not seem like the best choice at first,
but it should ease your burden and net you
some useful items.","","Craig"
"最後に、竜の力を帯びた“防具”の生産について――
これは、数は必要だが素材さえあれば作ってやれる
どうしても足りない防具ってのが出てくるだろう
そういう要望にも応えるから、遠慮はするな","Finally, producing Armor with dragon's power...
I can craft it given enough materials,
though the quantities are large. When you
face shortages, make sure to disassemble items.","","Craig"
"竜の力を帯びた“武器”の生産については
ソニアに任せるとしよう
オレが一手に引き受けるには
少々荷が重い","As for the production of ""weapons"" imbued
with dragon power, I will leave that to
Sonia. It’s a bit too much for me to take
on entirely by myself.","","Craig"
"――む、一息に話しすぎたか？
ジョゼフのやつに話が長いと言われて
気を付けたつもりだったんだがな","-Ah, I've been rambling, haven't I?
I meant to be careful since Joseph
said I can be a bit long-winded.","","Craig"
"“竜の力を帯びた武具”を
強化するための素材を得るには
武具を得た場所で拾ってくるか
そういった武具を“資源分解”するかだ","To acquire materials imbued with dragon's power,
you can either gather them from the location
where you acquired that equipment
or break down imbued weapons through
""Equipment Disassembly.""","","Craig"
"竜の力を帯びた“防具”を生産したいなら
素材を揃えてくれれば、オレが作ってやれる","If you wish to forge armor with the 
power of dragons, just collect the materials,
and I will craft it for you.","","Craig"
"だが、強化や“武器”の生産については
ソニアに聞いてくれ
彼女は良いポーンだ
きっと上手く手配してくれる","That being said, for enhancements
and weapon production, talk to Sonia.
She's one of our more reliable pawns,
she'll sort you out.","","Craig"
"何だ、急ぎの用でもあるのか？
一刻も早く伝えた方が良いと思ったんだが――
用が済んだら、また声をかけてくれ","Ah, pressing matters elsewhere?
I wanted to tell you this as soon as I could...
Return once your current business is sorted.","","Craig"
"ええ、話は伺っております
竜の力を帯びた素材があれば
特殊な武具を強化することもできましょう","Yes, I understand what you mean. 
If you possess materials with the 
power of dragons, we can strengthen 
special weapons too.","","Sonia"
"強化することで、武具に秘められていた
竜の力を引き出す――といったことも可能なはずです","Through enhancement, we can unlock
the hidden dragon's power sealed within
the weapons, allowing us to harness it.","","Sonia"
"武具と素材が集まった際には
ぜひともクラフトルームへおいでください
私たちポーンも、その時を心待ちにしております","Once you've gathered the equipment and materials,
do make your way to the craft room.
We pawns look forward to seeing you there.","","Sonia"
