"やあ――
あのね――
ちょっと頼みがあるんだ","Hey...
Listen...
I have a favor to ask.","","Klaus"
"僕はね、レスタニアに蓄積された
豊富な知識と、フィンダムの自然が育んだ
多彩な植物を組み合わせて
新たな薬を作れないかと考えているんだ","My idea is to merge Lestania's extensive
knowledge with Phindym's rich
natural flora to create new kinds of
medicine - that's my current project.","","Klaus"
"うまく行けば、これまで治せなかった
病気も治療可能になるかもしれない
もちろん、フィンダムの進歩にも
貢献できるだろうしね","If all goes well, we might be able to treat
illnesses that were previously incurable.
Of course, it could also contribute to
Phindym's progress.","","Klaus"
"いい話だろう？
でも、ジョゼフ様が大反対なんだ
もう、わけがわからないよ","Sounds good, right?
But Master Joseph strongly opposes it.
I just don't get it.","","Klaus"
"ねえ、ジョゼフ様を説得してくれないかな？
君の話なら耳を貸すと思うんだ","Hey, could you convince Master Joseph for me?
I think he'd listen to you.","","Klaus"
"ふう――
最近、疲れが取れなくてな――
面倒な話は、せめて一日おきにな","Sigh--
I haven't been able to shake off this fatigue
lately. At least space out the troublesome
requests to every other day.","","Joseph"
"クラウスめ、最近はことごとく
わたしに楯突いてくる","That Klaus, he's been opposing me at every
turn lately.","","Joseph"
"提案に反対なわけじゃない
ただ、時期尚早だと思うのだ
フィンダムが落ち着くまで
あと５年――１０年――","It's not that I oppose the proposal. I just
think it's too soon. Wait until Phindym
stabilizes--another 5... maybe 10 years.","","Joseph"
"それからでも遅くはない
わたしはとにかくクラウスが心配だ
おかしな毒を吸ってしまうのではないか
無茶をするのではないか――","There'll still be time then. I'm just worried
about Klaus. What if he inhales some strange
poison? What if he does something reckless--","","Joseph"
"ああ、言いたいことはいろいろあるが
一番重要なことだけ伝えておこう","I have many things to say, but
let me just tell you the most
important thing for now.","","Joseph"
"クラウスを――頼む","I beg you.","","Joseph"
"クラウスはどうせフィンダムに行くと
言い出すに違いない","Klaus will undoubtedly insist on going to Phindym.","","Joseph"
"隊長、一足先に行って安全を
確保してやってくれんか？","Captain, can you go on ahead and 
make it safe for him?","","Joseph"
"いやぁ――
ジョゼフ様にはがっかりだよ","Well...
I'm disappointed in Master Joseph.","","Klaus"
"そこで、お願いがあるんだけれど
フィンダムに行って向こうの植物を
いくつか採取してきてほしいんだ","So, here's my request: 
could you go to Phindym
and gather some plants from there?","","Klaus"
"薬のような効果を持つ植物が
必ずあるはずで、フィンダムの人なら
どこに生えているか知ってると思う","There must be plants with medicinal effects,
and the people of Phindym would know where
they grow.","","Klaus"
"フィンダムの植物を採取して欲しいんだ","I want you to gather Phindym's plants.","","Klaus"
"薬のような効果を持つ植物が
必ずあるはずで、フィンダムの人なら
どこに生えているか知ってると思う","There must be plants with medicinal effects,
and the people of Phindym would know where
they grow.","","Klaus"
"おお、あなただったか","Oh, it's you.","","Gearóid"
"実は――手紙をしたためていたのだ
レスタニアの医術――特に薬の精製の
知識で我々を助けてくれまいかと――","Actually... I was writing a letter.
Hoping Lestania's healing arts -
their knowledge of crafting medicine,
might assist us...?","","Gearóid"
"ふむ――そうか！
レスタニアにも同じことを考えている
者がいるというのか","Hmm... I see! So there are those in
Lestania who think the same way.","","Gearóid"
"ではさっそく、不思議な効能で知られる
植物の自生場所を伝えるよう
各地のエリアマスターに伝達しておこう","Then let's promptly inform the Area Masters
in each region to report the locations where
plants with curious effects grow.","","Gearóid"
"具体的な場所は彼らから聞いてほしい","Ask them for the specific locations.","","Gearóid"
"ただしその効力のせいか、魔物を引き寄せる
植物としても知られているものばかりだ","But, perhaps because of their potency, they're
also known to attract monsters.","","Gearóid"
"採集には、くれぐれも注意してくれ","Be very careful when gathering them.","","Gearóid"
"目的の植物の自生地は複数あるが
そのうちの２箇所から採集できれば
十分だろう","There are multiple locations where the target
plants grow, but gathering from two should
be enough.","","Gearóid"
"具体的な場所は各地のエリアマスターたちから
聞くといい","Ask the area masters for the specific
locations.","","Gearóid"
"来訪の目的は聞いています
お探しの植物は、そうですね","I've heard about your visit. 
The plant you're looking for... let's see.","","Arthfael"
"このモロー樹林の深層内を
探すと良いでしょう","You may want to look for this
within the depths of Morrow Forest.","","Arthfael"
"でも気を付けてください
その植物は、森の徘徊者に守られていますから","But be careful -
those plants are guarded by
forest wanderers.","","Arthfael"
"元気だったかい！？
フィンダムの医療に手を貸してくれるんだって！
こんなに嬉しいことはないよ","How have you been!?
I hear you're helping with Phindym's
medicinal work! 
Nothing could please me more.","","Razanailt"
"そう、あんたの求める植物なら、マヌンの集落
あたりを探すといいんだけれど
ちょっと厄介でね","The plant you're looking for should be near
the Manun settlement, but there's a bit of a
problem.","","Razanailt"
"植物に魅入られたみたいにその場を
離れない魔物がいるんだ
だから、くれぐれも気をつけるんだよ","There are monsters that won't leave the spot,
as if bewitched by the plants.
So be very careful.","","Razanailt"
"お久しぶりですね
レスタニアの覚者さま――","It has been a while,
Master Arisen of Lestania.","","Musel"
"お話はガラダの使者の方より聞いています
ぜひとも協力させてください","I've heard the details from Gearóid's envoy.
Please let me assist you.","","Musel"
"あなたが求める植物は、エラン水林奥地――
密林の鍾乳洞入口あたりで見つかるでしょう","The plant you seek can be found in the depths of 
Elan Water Grove--
near the Jungle Limestone Caves entrance.","","Musel"
"ですが――
そこには恐ろしい魔物が棲みついていると
聞いています
どうかご用心下さい","However...
I have heard that terrifying monsters
inhabit that place.
Please be careful.","","Musel"
"グリンデュアへようこそ
ふたたび貴君の顔を見れて嬉しく思うよ","Welcome back to Glyndwr.
It's good to see you once more.","","Ciarán"
"ガラダの使いの者から話は聞いている
件の植物なら、この峡谷の奥地にある
谷間を調べてみるといい","I heard from Gearóid's envoy.
The plant in question lies in
this gorge's farthest reaches.","","Ciarán"
"ただし、魔物を倒さなければ目的の品は
手に入らないと思った方がいいな","Just know you won't get your prize
without defeating the monsters
first. Best remember that.","","Ciarán"
"おお、見たところ、無事のようだな
しかも、植物の採集も首尾良く
終えたようだ","Ah, you seem unharmed. 
And it looks like you successfully got the plant.","","Gearóid"
"別の植物――ああ、あのことか","Another plant--oh, you mean that one.","","Gearóid"
"それなら、大いなる芯なる樹の樹内――
ヴァルテブル・ホールに行けば
必ず見つかるはずだ","Then, go to the heart of the Core Tree—
Valtable Hall. You'll surely find it there.","","Gearóid"
"クラウスには話したのだが――
やはり興味を持ったかな","I told Klaus about it--
I guess he's still interested.","","Gearóid"
"ホールには魔物がいるから
くれぐれも気をつけてな","There are monsters in the hall,
so be very careful.","","Gearóid"
"こちらは順調ですよ
じわりじわりと薬効成分の抽出中です
そちらはどうです？","Things are going well here.
We're gradually extracting the active
ingredients. How about over there?","","Camus"
"頼んだ植物は見つかったかな？
ガラダから聞いたんだろう？","Did you find the plants I asked for?
You heard about it from Gearóid, right?","","Klaus"
"クラウスめ、ついにカミュまで巻きこんで
大々的に動き始めたな
わたしに隠そうともせんわ","Klaus started making big moves
and even dragged Camus into it.
Not even trying to hide it from me.","","Joseph"
"ジョゼフ様ったら、クラウスのこと
気が気じゃないみたいですね
素直じゃないんだから、まったく","Master Joseph seems really worried about Klaus. 
Honestly, he's so stubborn.","","Elliot"
"フィンダムに行ってるんでしょ？
わたしも行こうかな","You're going to Phindym, right?
Maybe I'll go too.","","Lise"
"クラウスに頼まれたブツは手に入ったのか？
魔物がいて厄介らしいが、俺を巻きこむなよ","Did you get the stuff Klaus asked for?
Sounds like there are monsters causing trouble,
but don't drag me into it.","","Gurdolin"
"ジョゼフとクラウスのけんかだけで
俺はいっぱいいっぱいだぜ","Just Joseph and Klaus fighting is
more than enough for me.","","Gurdolin"
