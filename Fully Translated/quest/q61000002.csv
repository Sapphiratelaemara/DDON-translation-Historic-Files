"いよいよ、といったところだな――
オレも、オレなりに黒竜と戦うにあたって
覚者に何が必要なのか考えてみた","At last, we've arrived at this point...
I've tried to consider what's
needed for the Arisen to fight
against the Black Dragon in my own way.","","Craig"
"武具を鍛える者として
覚者隊の統率たるお前にも
ぜひ伝えておきたい","As a smith, I want to ensure you,
the commander of the Arisen,
is informed of this as well.","","Craig"
"覚者が黒竜に立ち向かうには
やはり竜の力が不可欠だ
――だが、黒竜は他の大陸を侵攻し
もはや他の竜を凌ぐ力を持っているだろう","To stand against the Black Dragon,
the Arisen needs the power of dragons.
However, the Black Dragon has conquered
other lands, and likely exceeds
all other Dragons in strength.","","Craig"
"では、黒竜に対抗できる力は
もうこの世に存在しないのか？
そうは考えたくない――まだ諦めたくはない","So, is there no power in this world
that can oppose the Black Dragon?
I refuse to believe that... 
I'm not ready to accept defeat.","","Craig"
"――黒竜が全ての闇を統べるというのなら
全ての竜で対抗すれば望みがあるのではないか
いや、全ての竜の力で対抗するよりほか
ないのではないか","If the Black Dragon rules all darkness,
then harnessing every Dragon's might
may be our only hope. No... it must be our
sole focus.","","Craig"
"これがオレの答えだ
――つまり、オレにできる最大の協力は
竜の力の宿った武具を合成し
よりその力を高めていくことだと考えたわけだ","This is my answer-
the ultimate aid I can provide
is forging gear bearing dragon power
and continuously enhancing it.","","Craig"
"だから、竜の力の宿った武具を集めておいてほしい
間違っても捨てたり売ったりしないようにな
分解する時も気を付けてくれ","Therefore, I want you to collect
equipment that holds dragon power.
Don't discard or sell them by mistake. Be sure
to handle them with care when disassembling.","","Craig"
"む――
いや、これを伝えるのは
最早オレの義務といってもいい
聞く気になるまで、待ってるからな！","Hmm... No—this is something
I must tell you, no matter what.
I'll wait until you're ready to lend an ear!","","Craig"
