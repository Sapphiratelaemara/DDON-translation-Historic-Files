"おや、ひとりか
入れ違いになったようだな","Alone, huh? You must've walked past each other
without noticing.","","Joseph"
"メイリーフが、小鳥のことで相談があると
ここに来ていたのだ
それがどうにも要領を得ない話でな――","Mayleaf was here concerning
some bird issue, though her
explanation was unclear...","","Joseph"
"そういうことなら隊長が得意だろうから
探して相談するといい――そう言っておいた
あとは頼んだぞ","I said the captain would be good at this,
so go and ask them...
Left it to you.","","Joseph"
"メイリーフは――
はて、少し前までそのあたりにいたのだが","Mayleaf... Well, she was here
not too long ago, but...","","Joseph"
"メイリーフかい？
うーん、自分の家じゃないかなあ","Mayleaf? Maybe she's at home.","","Klaus"
"小鳥の様子がおかしい――変だって
ずいぶん心配していたからね","The little bird was acting strange—
She was really worried about how odd it seemed.","","Klaus"
"ほら、あのキースヒルトから贈られた
小鳥なんだってさ","That little bird was a gift from
Kieshildt, or so I heard...","","Klaus"
"ああ、隊長さん
メイリーフの頼みをきいてあげて","Captain, can you hear Mayleaf out?","","Pamela"
"ずっと小鳥の心配ばかりで――
このままではメイリーフが倒れてしまいそうなの","She’s been so worried about the bird—
if this continues, she might collapse.","","Pamela"
"見て、隊長さん！","Look, Captain!","","Mayleaf"
"わたしのヒルティが――
ほら、悲しそうに鳴いているでしょう？","My Hilti-
See how sad she sounds?","","Mayleaf"
"隊長、まずはメイリーフの話を聞いてみて","Captain, listen to what Mayleaf has to say first.","","Lise"
"隊長さん、お願いします
ヒルティはキースヒルトから預かった
大切な小鳥なの","Captain, please. Hilti is a precious bird
entrusted to me by Kieshildt.","","Mayleaf"
"手分けして南の森を調べて
その後、合流することにしよう","Let's split up and check the southern forest
and then we'll meet up.","","Lise"
"何事もなければいいのだけど――","I hope nothing’s wrong...","","Pamela"
"久しぶりだね
リズはもう到着しているよ","Long time no see. Lise has already arrived.","","Rondejeel"
"さすが、対応が早いわね
詳しい話は聞いている？
ああ、そうでもないんだ","That was quick indeed.
Are you up to speed already?
Ah, not really then...","","Ringdeel"
"――いつからだったかな","...When did it start, I wonder.","","Ringdeel"
"まず、森から鳥たちが減ってしまったの
次は小動物で、そして今は
中型の肉食動物たちも滅多に見なくなったわ","First, the birds disappeared from the forest.
Then small animals, and now even mid-sized
predators are rarely seen.","","Ringdeel"
"動物たちが戻らないと、森の姿が
変わってしまって、最悪の場合は
森が死んでしまうかもしれないよね","If the animals don't return, the
forest will change, and worst case,
it might even die completely...","","Ringdeel"
"もしかしたら、白竜様にまた何か起こったのかと
思ったけど、そんなことはないっていうし――
だとすると、原因はなんだろうね","I thought maybe something happened to Lord White
Dragon again, but they said that wasn't the case—
so then, what could be the cause?","","Ringdeel"
"ああ、隊長
このあたりを歩きまわってみたけど
やっぱりこれまでとは雰囲気がちがうの","Ah, Captain.
I tried walking around the area, but the 
atmosphere really is different from before.","","Lise"
"ロンドジールが少し調べたみたいだから
直接聞いてみて","It seems Rondejeel looked into it a bit,
so try asking directly.","","Lise"
"詳しいことはロンドジールから聞いてみて","Ask Rondejeel for the details.","","Lise"
"最近、森の動物がすっかり減ってしまって――
たまに見つけても、とても怯えているんだ","Lately, the forest animals have decreased
considerably. Even when I occasionally find
one, they're extremely frightened.","","Rondejeel"
"まあ、正確には、怯えているように見えるという
意味だけど――","Well, to be precise, 
they appear to be terrified...","","Rondejeel"
"僕には、様子が変ということしかわからないけど
その感じはエルテ・ディナンに近づくほど
強い気がするよ","All I can tell is that something feels off, but
that sensation seems to grow stronger the closer
I get to Erte Deenan.","","Rondejeel"
"どうだろう――
エルテ・ディナンへ行って、森の異変の
原因を探って欲しいんだ
もちろん、解決してくれれば最高だよ","What do you say... Head to Erte Deenan
to uncover why the forest changed.
Fixing it would be ideal, naturally.","","Rondejeel"
"エルテ・ディナンで一体何が起きているんだろう
どうも胸騒ぎがするんだ","What's really occurring in Erte Deenan?
Something feels wrong about this...","","Rondejeel"
"キースヒルトか――
話は聞いてるけど――ああ、会いたかったな","Kieshildt, huh...
I've heard the stories.
Ah, I wish I could've met them.","","Lise"
"ねえ、隊長？","Hey, Captain?","","Lise"
"この森、この古い街――
エルフの代わりに、わたしたちが
守っていかないとね","This forest, this ancient city—
we must protect it in place of the elves.","","Lise"
"ねえ、神殿へ帰ろう
ジョゼフ様に報告しなくちゃ","Hey, let's go back to the temple.
We have to report to Master Joseph.","","Lise"
"キースヒルトはもういない――
――もういないって","Kieshildt is gone...
Gone forever.","","Mayleaf"
"何度自分に言いきかせても
信じることができなかったんだ","No matter how many times I told myself,
I couldn't bring myself to believe it.","","Mayleaf"
"でも――無理して信じることなんて
ないんだよね","But... 
you can't force yourself to believe something.","","Mayleaf"
"わたしには世の不思議も
――難しいこともわからないけど
とにかく、みんなが無事で良かったわ","Though I can't grasp life's mysteries
or difficult matters, at least I'm
thankful everyone came out unharmed...","","Pamela"
"キースヒルトが小鳥を使って君たちを
動かしたなんて、どうにも信じられないね","I can't truly believe Kieshildt used birds
to manipulate you all like that.","","Klaus"
"理屈をつけるとしたら――
うん――エルフはとてつもなく長命だから
その思いが、巡る竜力に濃く残る――","If I had to explain it... 
Hmm...
Elves live for incredibly long spans, making
their feelings persist in the Dragon Force.","","Klaus"
"その結果――なんてのはどうかな","Right... how about something like that?","","Klaus"
"ゲルトから話は聞いた
ご苦労だった","I heard about it from Gerd.You did well.","","Joseph"
"オークの件はなんらかの対処が必要だな
ヴァネッサに伝えておこう","Something needs to be done about the orcs.
I'll let Vanessa know.","","Joseph"
"それにしてもキースヒルトか――
まったく、エルフは不思議な種族だな
もっと話したかったわ","Still, Kieshildt...
Elves truly are a mysterious race.
I wish we could have talked more.","","Joseph"
