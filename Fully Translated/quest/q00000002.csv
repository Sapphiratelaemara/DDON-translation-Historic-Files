future, rests upon our shoulders."
"もうひとつの務めは
白竜の砦となり、盾として戦うこと","Another duty of ours is to become a bulwark of
the White Dragon, to fight as their shield."

防衛隊はあちこちの小競り合いで敗走を重ね
グリッテン砦への侵入まで許してしまった","Recently, the Orc's offensive momentum has
increased, and the Defense Corps have been
repeatedly driven to defeat in skirmishes against

覚者になった意味を考えてくれ
そうすれば、生き方が見えてくるだろう","As this harsh season arrives,

残されていたのは
あなたたち覚者を生み出す力だけでした","Lord White Dragon exhausted the majority of his 
Dragon Force 300 years ago.

幾人もの――異例なことですが――幾人もの
覚者を誕生させたのです","Lord White Dragon exerted his last

今では時折目覚めては覚者を生み出すくらい――","The petrification of the whole body began 
afterwards, and now he only occasionally 
wakes up and produces an Arisen--"
"竜力の減退で野山の活力までもが弱まり
それに乗じてオークや魔物が力をつけています","With the decline of Dragon Force,

わたしはそう願わずにはいられません
あなたの力を、ぜひ、貸してください","I hope that the resurrection of 
Lord White Dragon will be in time.
I cannot help but wish for it.
Please, lend me your power."

この神殿を中心とする政（まつりごと）の
取りまとめが主な仕事だ","Even if I say ""priest"",

長い時間をかけて造りあげたのがこの神殿だ","The people of Lestania, 
concerned about the white dragon that crashed here

すべてが白竜を守る力となるのだ","A solid temple, the Arisen, the Knight Order――

-- alright?

ジョゼフ様の助手さ
まあ、使いっ走りみたいなものだね","I am Klaus,
the assistant of Master Joseph.
Well, I suppose I'm more like a errand boy."

"覚者たちのほとんどは神殿の外――
レスタニアのあちこちを駆け巡っているよ","Most of the Arisen are outside the temple - 
running around Lestania."
"もちろん、レオが一声かければ
大勢の覚者が集まるわけだけど","Of course, if Leo were to call out,
many Arisen would gather together."
"ところで君は《ブラッドオーブ》を知ってるかい？
白竜様に捧げると石化の進行を
食い止めることができるんだ","By the way, do you know about the ""Blood Orb""? 
If you offer it to Lord White Dragon, 
you can halt the progression of petrification."
"でも、なかなか手に入らなくてさ
《ブラッドオーブ》のことは
いつでも頭の片隅で気にしておくといい","But, it's quite hard to get, you know.
It's good to always keep the thought 
of the 《Blood Orb》
in the back of your mind."
"わたしは白衛騎士団――通称白騎団の
団長を拝命しているゲルトだ","I am Gerd, 
the Commander of the White Guard Knights, 
also known as the White Knights."
"見たところ、貴殿は覚者になって日も浅いようだ","From what I can see, 
t seems that you have recently become an Arisen."
"これから見聞を広げるのだろうが、
先輩たち――特に覚者から、くだらない偏見を
吹き込まれないようにな","You're about to broaden your horizons,
but make sure not to let the seniors,
especially among the Arisen, instill
foolish prejudices in you."
"残念なことに覚者の中には
我々騎士団を下に見る者もいる
例えば、こんな陰口をきいたことはないか？","Unfortunately, among the Arisen, there are 
those who look down upon our knight order. 
Have you ever heard such slander such as this?"
"ミミズのフンほどのわずかな報酬のために
騎士になった者がいる――","There are those who become knights 
for the sake of a reward as meager as worm dung."
"違うぞ！　断じて違う！","That's not true! Absolutely not true!"
"我々は全て、白竜様のために
レスタニアのために！
そこに生きる人々のために剣と命を捧げたのだ","For the sake of the White Dragon,
and for the sake of Lestania!
We have devoted our swords and lives
for the people who live there."
"貴殿たち覚者のように、運命でも使命でもなく――","Like you, noble Arisen, not bound by fate or purpose--"
"戦いに背を向けることもできたのに
それをいさぎよしとせず、騎士になる道を選んだ
意志と奉仕の塊が、我々白衛騎士団なのだ","Even though we could have turned 
our backs on the fight,
we chose the path to become knights.
The embodiment of will and service, 
we are the White Guard Knights."
"もし、貴殿の態度にナめた様子があれば
容赦なく思い知らせてやるからな","If I see any nonsense in your attitude,
I will show you no mercy."
"ええと――
自己紹介はしたんだっけ？　まだだっけ？

Well, it's okay... I'm Iris."
"たいていはレオとつるんでいて
あちこち走り回っているの","I usually hang out with Leo and 
run around here and there."
"覚者の連絡係みたいなものだね
結構大変な仕事だから頼りになりそうなら
仕事、譲ってもいいよ","It's like I'm the Arisen's liaison.
It's quite a demanding job,
so if you seem reliable,
I might pass it on to you."
"覚者ってさ、みんな基本的に、バラバラに
生きているんだよね","The Arisen, you know, everyone basically lives
their own lives, scattered all over the place."
"心臓が時を刻まないから、時間が幾らでも
あるでしょ？
だからさ、いろんなこと考えちゃうんだ","Since your heart doesn't beat time, 
you have all the time in the world, right?
That's why you think about all sorts of things."
"覚者とは？人生とは？自分って何？とかさ","What is an Arisen? 
What is life? 
What is self? 
I wonder."
"もちろん、白竜を守るのが本業だけど
その守り方も、ただ戦うだけじゃなくて
覚者ならではの方法を探すべき――とか
いろいろな考え方があるわけよ","Of course, 
protecting the White Dragon is our main duty,
but our approach to protecting it isn't just about 
fighting.

As Arisen, 
we should seek out methods unique to us――
there are various ways of thinking, you know."
"覚者も騎士団みたいにビシッと組織にした方が
いいって意見もあるけど――
どうなんだろうね","There are also opinions that it would be better 
to organize the Arisen like a knight order and 
be more organized.
I wonder how that would be."
"あ、わたしは深く考えない派なので、よろしく！","Ah, I'm not the type to think deeply, so, 
nice to meet you!"
"白竜様が力を取り戻すまで
わたしたちが世の理を守らねばなりません","Until Lord White Dragon regains his power,
we must protect the order of the world."
"特に、覚者の皆さんの責任は重大です
白竜様のご期待をゆめゆめお忘れなく","In particular, the responsibility of 
all the Arisen is significant. 
Please never forget the 
expectations of Lord White Dragon."

and make sure they remember your face."
"レオがこんなに世話をやくなんて
どういう風の吹き回しだろうね
よっぽどあんたが気に入ったらしいよ","Leo is really taking care of you.
I wonder what's got into him.
Seems like he really likes you."
"あのさぁ――","Hey, you know..."
"神殿以外にも《拠点》があるのは
知っているよね？","Did you know that there are 
other locations outside of the temple?"
"村だったり、特別な施設があったり――
そこの住人が助けを求めていたり――","It could be a village, or a special facility,
where the residents are looking for help--"
"いろいろあるから、時間があるなら
あちこち行ってみた方がいいよ","There's a lot going on, so if you have the time,
you should go all over the place."
"ここんところジョゼフ様が老け込んじゃって
結構重要な仕事を任せてもらえるようになったんだ","Master Joseph has been getting old these days,
so I've been entrusted with quite important tasks."
"うれしいけど――重圧もあってさ――
時々、話しを聞いてくれるとうれしいな","I'm glad you're here -- 
but I'm also under a lot of pressure.
I'd love it if you'd talk to me from time to time."
"レオに期待されるということは――
危険な場所に行く機会が多いということだ
精進と用心を忘れなさんな","What Leo expects is that you have a lot 
of opportunities to go to dangerous places.
Do not forget diligence and caution."
"オークどもとの戦争が続く限り
背中を預け合って戦う機会がすぐに来る
貴殿の力はその時に見せてもらおう","As long as the war with the Orcs continues,
the opportunity to fight 
shoulder to shoulder will come soon.
I look forward to seeing your strength 
at that time."
"白竜様は一日の多くを眠って過ごしますが
ごくわずかながらお目覚めの時もあります
そんな時は、お話だってできますよ","Lord White Dragon spends much of the day sleeping,
but there are also moments when he wakes up,
and during those times, 
he can have a conversation with you."
"まあ、最初のうちは言われるがままに
戦っていればいいさ","Well, in the beginning, 
just do as you're told and fight."
"そのうち、自分なりの生き方が
見えてくるはずだ","Eventually, 
you should be able to see your own way of living."
"どれどれどれ？","Hmm, I wonder..."
"レオはあんたのどこが気に入ったのかな？
それともただの気まぐれか――なんてね","What does Leo like about you?
Or is it just a whim?"
"君はどんな覚者人生を歩むんだろうね","I wonder what kind of life as an 
Arisen you will lead."
"冒険者みたいな生き方もいいけど
僕としては神殿のために尽力して欲しい――","You can live like an adventurer,
but for my part, 
I want you to do your best for the temple--"
"いや、最近、少ないんだよね、そういう覚者","No, there aren't many of those Arisen these days."
"ここで見聞したことを外で話す時は
その判断を慎重に行うようにな","Be careful about your judgment when 
talking about what you have seen here outside."
"秘密は可能な限り少なくしたいが
内容によってはそうもいかん","I want to minimize the secretkeeping 
as much as possible, 
but depending on the subject, 
it may not be possible."
"どうした？　時間を持て余しているのなら
オークの一匹でも倒してくるがいい","What's wrong? If you're just wasting time, 
go ahead and defeat even one Orc."
"戦士に大切なことは
百の無駄口より剣のひと振り――忘れるな","The important thing for a warrior is 
the swing of a sword, not empty words――
don't forget."
