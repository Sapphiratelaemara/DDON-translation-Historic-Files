"ドリード城内部は複雑だ
先行している騎士をマーカーで追い、情報を得ていくといい！命の器は地下にあるようだ","The interior of Dreed Castle is complex. 
It would be good to follow the knights who are 
ahead of you with markers and gather information! 
The Vessel of Life seems to be located underground."
"一瞬でいい――","Just for a moment—"
"俺たちが白竜の力を
継承できる程度でかまわない――","It's okay if we can inherit
just a fraction of the White Dragon's power—"
"それほどに白竜を目覚めさせるには
どうしたらよいのか――","What should we do to awaken the White Dragon
to such an extent?"
"ジョゼフはアークのことで頭がいっぱいだ
相談したら《ブラッドオーブ》を探せと言われた
おれが抱える焦りが伝わらないんだ","Joseph is preoccupied with the Ark.
When I consulted him, 
he told me to find the ""Blood Orb.""
He doesn't seem to sense the urgency I feel."
"竜の覚醒――
方法は自分たちで探すしかないのか","Awakening the Dragon--
We'll just have to find a way to do it ourselves."
"レオが深刻な顔をして
わたしを見ているのです","Leo is looking at me with a serious expression."
"何かありましたか？","Did something happen?"
"白竜様の覚醒はいつか――","When will the awakening of 
Lord White Dragon occur?"
"わたしには、時が来たら
としかお答えできません","I can only answer when the time comes."
"わたしの仕事は
白竜様の意志を伝えること――","My job is to convey
the will of Lord White Dragon."
"人々の願いの
代弁者ではないのです","I am not the spokesperson for people's desires."
"白竜の目を覚ます――
ふん、レオの差し金か","Waking the white dragon--
Hmm, Leo sent you."
"あの眠りで竜力が回復するのだ
その邪魔をするつもりか？","That sleep restores Dragon Force.
Are you going to interrupt that?"
"賛成しかねるな","I cannot agree with that."
"何より、すべがなかろう","Above all, there's no way to do it."
"ねえ――
ゴブリンキングから手に入れた古文書！
あれの解読が終わったんだ","Hey... I finished deciphering the ancient 
document we obtained from the Goblin King!"
"竜の石化を解く方法を見つけたと思う","I think I've found a way to undo the

"試してみるかい？","Would you like to give it a try?"
"もし、その気があったら
これから《ドリード城》へ向かってほしい","If you're feeling up to it, 
I want you to head towards Dreed Castle."
"昔々、白騎団の本拠地だったところでね
今は色々な物の保管庫になっている","Once upon a time, 
it was the stronghold of the White Knights.
Now, it has become a storage facility 
for various items."
"そうそう、今回の古文書だって元々は
ドリード城に保管されていたものだ","Oh, that's right. Even this ancient document was 
originally stored in Dreed Castle."
"いや、保管というよりは
封じたという言い方が正しいかな
あそこには世に出ては困るものが
いっぱいある","No, I think it's more accurate to say that it was 
sealed. 
There are a lot of things there that shouldn't 
be released into the world."
"というわけで、今回ばかりはジョゼフ様には
絶対秘密にして欲しい","So, this time, I really need you to 
keep this a secret from Joseph."
"じゃあ、それぞれこっそり出発して、現地集合だ
これは城で使う鍵――
中できっと必要になるから渡しておくよ","Well then, let's each secretly depart and 
meet up at the destination. 

This is the key used in the castle. 

I'm giving it to you because we'll 
definitely need it inside."
"ええと、あとは――","Um, as for the rest..."
"そうそう、レオには君から話してほしい
また勝手な行動か、と思われたくないからね","Oh, that's right. I want Leo to hear it from you. 
I don't want him to think I'm acting selfishly."
"レオへの報告を忘れないでくれよ
そして《ドリード城》で会おう！","Don't forget to report to Leo
and let's meet at Dreed Castle!"
"白竜の目を覚ます方法があれば――","If there is a way to awaken the White Dragon..."
"ほう――クラウスとおまえでなんとかするだと？
《ドリード城》へ行く？","Well... you and Klaus are going to work it out, 
aren't you?
Go to Dreed Castle?"
"わかった
しかし《ドリード城》への道中にある関所は
このところ厳しく通行を制限しているんだ","Understood. 
However, the checkpoints along the way to 
Dreed Castle have recently been 
enforcing strict travel restrictions."
"よし、いいだろう――
おれが通達を出しておく
しかし、手助けはそこまでだ
あとは自分の才覚で切り抜けてくれ","Alright, fine――
I will issue the order.
However, I can only assist you up to that point.
The rest is up to your own talent to overcome."
"クラウスが何を考えているか知らないが――
期待して待たせてもらうよ","I don't know what Klaus is thinking, 
but I'll wait with anticipation."
"――あんたが通達に名前のあった覚者か","Are you the Arisen whose name 
was mentioned in the order?"
"もちろん通行は許可するが、ここから先は
魔物の数、そして強さが段違いだ
心して進んでくれよ","Of course, we will allow your passage.
But beyond this point, the number and strength of 
the enemies are on a completely different level. 
Proceed with caution."
"ドリードはかつて騎士団の本拠地だった城だ
その頃の、古い見取り図を頼りに
先行隊が奥へ向かっている","Dreed was once the castle that served as the 
headquarters of the Knights' Order. 
The advance party is now heading deeper into the 
castle, relying on an old blueprint from that time."
"彼らの居場所を目印に追うといいだろう","You might want to follow their 
whereabouts as a landmark."
"覚者よ、注意しろ
内部は魔物だらけの上に――","Arisen, be cautious.
For the depths are filled with nothing but enemies -"
"地下牢や水路で相当複雑だ
道を間違えると、どこに出るかわからんぞ","The underground dungeons and waterways 
are quite complex. 
If you take the wrong path, 
you won't know where you'll end up."
"覚者よ、この螺旋階段を下るんだ
２階層下に礼拝堂に続く通路がある","Arisen, descend this spiral staircase.
There is a passage leading to the chapel 
two floors below."
"目的のモノがあるとしたら、最深部の
旧礼拝堂――団長がそう言っていた","If there's something you're looking for, 
it's in the deepest part of the old chapel - 
that's what the Commander said."
"何があるのかまでは
俺は聞かされてないけどな","I haven't been told what exactly is there."
"ああ覚者さん！　やっときてくれたか
どうやらその扉の先が礼拝堂らしい","Ah, Ser Arisen! You've finally arrived I see. 
It seems that beyond that door is the chapel."
"鍵はないし、魔物は多いし
まったくどうしようかと思ったよ","There are no keys, and there are many enemies.
I really didn't know what to do."
"さぁ、今度はあんたが先導してくれ","Now, it's your turn to lead the way."
"押せ押せ！　斬り込め！","Push, push!　Cut it down!"
"退くな！　ひるむな！","Do not retreat!　Don't flinch!"
"白騎団！　覚者に負けるな！","White Knights! Don't lose to the Arisen!"
"弱点を見極めろ！","Find the weakness!"
"見ろ、虫の息だ！","Look, it's on its last legs!"
"あとひと押し！","One more push!"
"こ、こんな怪物ははじめてだ！","This is the first time I've beheld such a monster!"
"無茶だよ、こんなの！","This is absurd, I can't believe this!"
"くっ――手強い！","Hngh... This is tough!"
"くそ――負けるか――","Damn... I won't lose..."
"ドリード城から命の器を持ち帰って――
その中には魔物の命を詰め込んで
竜に捧げればいいんじゃないか","Bring back the Vessel of Life from Dreed Castle...
Fill it with the life force of slain monsters and 
offer it to the Dragon."
"僕が考えていたのはそういうことで――","That's what I was thinking--"
"器が仲間たちの命でいっぱいになるなんて
思ってもいなかったんだ
やりきれないよ――","I never imagined the vessel would be filled 
with the lives of my comrades.
It's unbearable—"
"ドリード城での出来事は聞いた","I heard about the events at Dreed Castle."
"その器に詰まっているのは
敵、味方の命――失われた命であることもな","The vessel is filled with lives,
both enemy and ally—lives that were lost."
"なるほど、その命を捧げれば白竜の石化は
止まり、意識も明瞭になるのかもしれない","I see. So offering those lives might stop the 
White Dragon's petrification and 
restore its consciousness."
"しかし、その方法は――
このレスタニアが３００年前に捨てた
忌まわしき知恵の産物なのだ","However, this method... is the product of the 
detestable wisdom that Lestania abandoned 
300 years ago."
"わたしは――賛成できない
しかし、反対もしない","I cannot agree.
But also, I do not oppose it."
"失われた命と言ったが――
白竜に捧げることでその命は生き続けるとも
いえるのかもしれない","But perhaps it can be said that by dedicating it 
to the White Dragon, 
those lost lives will continue to live on."
"それを思うと――反対するわけには
いかないのだ","When I think about it--I can't disagree."
"この戦いで命を落とした部下たちのために――
貴殿も祈ってやってくれ","For my subordinates who lost 
their lives in this battle—
please pray for them as well."
"白竜――目覚めるかな？","White Dragon――Will you awaken?"
"おれが求めたことにはこれほどの代償が
必要だというのか――？","Is this the price that must be paid for what I 
have sought after?"
"求めてはいけなかったのか――","Was it something we shouldn't have searched for?"
"よく、考えましたか？
皆と相談しましたか？","Have you thought carefully?
Have you discussed it with everyone?"
"その器の中身を白竜様に捧げる――","I offer the contents of this vessel 
to Lord White Dragon."
"その是非、今一度考えた上で
よろしければ、器をわたしに――","Please consider this once more, and if you're 
still willing, give me the Vessel."
"準備できたら声を掛けてくれ","Give me a shout when you're ready."
"一緒にやりたいこと、相談したいこと――
頼みたいことが山ほどある","There are so many things I want to do with you, 
things I want to talk to you about-- 
so much I want to ask you for help with."
