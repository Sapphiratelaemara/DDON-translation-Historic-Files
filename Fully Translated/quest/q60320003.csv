"実はな
今、ある魔物を追跡中なんだよ
手が空いてるなら手伝ってもらえないか？","Actually, I'm currently tracking an enemy.
If you're free, could you lend me a hand?","","Dean"
"追跡中って言っても
その魔物がどこにいるかはわかってないんだ
今、追っているのはその魔物の“痕跡”さ","Even though I say I'm tracking it,
I don't know where the enemy is.
For now, I'm following its ""traces.""","","Dean"
"“痕跡”を辿っていけば、必ずヤツはそこにいる
だが――さっきヘマしたお陰でケガをしちまってな
重傷ってわけじゃないが、素早く動けそうにない
俺の代わりに魔物を追ってくれないか？","If you follow the ""traces,"" you'll find it for sure.
But...I messed up earlier and got hurt.
It's not serious, but I can't move quickly.
Can you track the enemy in my place?","","Dean"
"追跡を開始する","Begin the pursuit.","","Dean"
"――少し待ってほしい","...Wait a minute.","","Dean"
"“痕跡”を辿っていけば、必ずヤツはそこにいる
すまないが、俺の代わりに追ってくれ","If you follow the ""traces,"" you'll
find it for sure. Sorry, but can you
track it in my place?","","Dean"
"時間をかけすぎると相手が気付く可能性がある
大胆かつ慎重に――よろしく頼むぜ","If you take too long, the target might notice.
Be bold but safe...I'm counting on you.","","Dean"
"さすが覚者さんだな！
あんたに頼んでよかったぜ
これで魔物が集まりやすい場所も分かったし
メガドシスの警備事情も一歩前進だな","As expected of you, Arisen!
I'm glad we asked you.
Now that we know where our enemies gather,
Megado's security has taken a step forward.","","Dean"
"さあ、追跡だ――相手に気付かれる前に見つけちまってくれ","Now, the pursuit...
Find it before it notices you.","","Dean"
"相手の動きが少し変わったな――ちょいと急いだ方がいいんじゃないか","The target's movements have changed...
You might want to hurry up.","","Dean"
"完全にバレちまったなこりゃ――やり直しだ","It's onto us... Time to start over.","","Dean"
"魔物がいそうな場所の目星は大体ついてる
地図に印をつけておくから、そこを当たってみてくれ","I've got a rough idea of where they might be.
I'll mark it on the map... Check there.","","Dean"
"あんまり時間をかけすぎると
相手が気付く可能性があるからな
時間をかけすぎないようによろしく頼むぜ","If you take too long, the target might notice.
So make haste... I'm counting on you.","","Dean"
"ああ、少し特殊な任務だからな
しっかり準備してから
また声をかけてくれ","Ah, this is somewhat of a special mission.
Prepare properly, then come talk to me again.","","Dean"
