"珍しい素材が取れる洞窟を教えてやる――
バシアスから、あんたにどうしても
教えてやってくれと頼まれてな","Let me tell you about this cave
that you can find rare materials in.
Bacias made sure that I tell you.","","Randolf"
"ウルテカ山岳は火山の影響もあって
とても自然豊かとは言えないが
この洞窟の中は別だ――様々な素材が取れる","The Urteca Mountains aren't very bountiful
due to the volcano's influence, but this cave
is different. You can get various materials here.","","Randolf"
"地図にマークを付けておいてやるから
中の様子を見てくるといい――
魔物がウヨウヨいるから、準備だけは怠るなよ","I'll mark it on your map. Go take a look inside.
There are monsters swarming around,
so don't slack on your preparations.","","Randolf"
"それと最後に――洞窟が今
どうなっているかだけは教えてくれ
しばらく様子を見に行けていなくてな
それ以外は好きにやってもらってかまわん","One last thing. Just make note how the cave
is doing. I haven't been able to check on it for
a while. Other than that, do as you like.","","Randolf"

"ふん、無事に戻ってきたようだな
で――中の様子はどうだった？","Hmm, you made it back in one piece.
So, how was it inside?","","Randolf"
"なるほどな――心配していたほど
悪いようにはなっていないようだ","I see. It doesn't seem as bad
as I was worried it might be.","","Randolf"
"今後も好きに活用してくれ
お前が出入りするようになれば
自然と魔物も減っていくだろうさ","Feel free to make use of it from now on.
If you frequent there, the monsters' presence
will naturally decrease.","","Randolf"
