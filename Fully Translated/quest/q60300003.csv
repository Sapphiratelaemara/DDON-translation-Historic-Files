What’s more, you can try this as 
many times as you like.","","Craig"

アレで試してみるのもいいだろう","If you don’t have any ★4 equipment,
you can enhance one via crafting to reach ★4.
—Ah, the equipment I gave you before is ★4.
You could try using that.","","Craig"

A skill I gained through years of wandering.
... Make full use of it.","","Craig"
