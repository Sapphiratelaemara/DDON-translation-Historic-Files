"覚者さま、自室もそろそろ手狭ではありませんか？
実は、より快適に過ごしていただくため
改築をご提案しようかと――","Ser Arisen, isn't your private 
quarters getting a bit cramped?
Actually, to make your stay more comfortable,
I was thinking of proposing a renovation--","","Barton"
"自室を改築するためには
何通りかの方法がありましてな
どの方法が覚者さまに合うか、ご相談させて
いただけませんかな？","There are several ways to renovate your private quarters.
Shall we discuss which method 
suits you best, Ser Arisen?","","Barton"
"改築作業の進め方ですが、二通りあるのです
まず一つ目――
私に改築用の素材を渡していただければ
大工に作業を依頼しておきましょう","There are two ways to proceed with the renovation.
First--
If you provide me with the necessary materials,
I can arrange for a carpenter to do the work.","","Barton"
"ただし、大工の腕までは保証できません
素材は少し多めに納品していただき、
作業時間もゆとりを見て取らねばなりません","However, I cannot guarantee the carpenter's skill.
You'll need to provide extra materials,
and allow ample time for the work to be completed.","","Barton"
"もう一方の方法は――
熟練の大工を、覚者さまご自身に見極め
集めていただくというものです","The other method is this―
You, Ser Arisen, must personally assess
and gather skilled carpenters.","","Barton"
"熟練の大工であれば、少ない素材で
素早く作業を終わらせてくれることでしょう
しかし、作業を請け負ってくれる者を探すため
何人かに声をかけねばならんでしょうな","Skilled carpenters can complete the work quickly
with fewer materials.
But you'll need to approach several people
to find those willing to take on the job.","","Barton"
"素材を揃えていただくか
大工を探してきていただくか――
覚者さまのご都合の良い方法は
どちらですかな？","Will you gather the materials yourself,
or seek out carpenters...
Which method is more 
convenient for you, Ser Arisen?","","Barton"
"必要な素材を渡す","Gather the needed materials","","Barton"
"自分で人員を集める","Gather personnel myself","","Barton"
"――少し考えさせてほしい","...I want to think a bit","","Barton"
"わかりました
では、必要な素材を持ってきてくださるのを
お待ちしております","Understood.
I'll await your return with the 
necessary materials.","","Barton"
"わかりました
それでは覚者さま
工事作業を引き受けてくれる者たちを探し、
依頼の話をしておいていただけると助かります","Understood.
Then, Ser Arisen, please seek out those willing 
to take on the construction work
and arrange for their services.","","Barton"
"ええ、もちろんです
自室で庭でも眺めながら
ゆっくりお考えになってください","Yes, of course.
Please take your time to think it over
while enjoying the garden view in your room.","","Barton"
"自室の改築に着手するには
まだ素材が足りないようですな
引き続き、お待ちしております","It seems you still lack sufficient materials
to begin renovating your private quarters.
I'll continue to wait for your return.","","Barton"
"おお、改築に必要な素材が揃いましたな
これだけあれば十分でしょう","Ah, you've gathered all the materials 
needed for the renovation.
This should be more than enough.","","Barton"
"今回の工事作業は騎士団の方々が
引き受けてくださることになっています
じきに、自室内での作業が始まります
作業完了まで、お時間をいただきますぞ","This construction work will be handled
by the knights' order. Work inside your
rooms will begin shortly; We'll need
some time until completion.","","Barton"
"工事作業を引き受けてくれる者たちを探し、
依頼の話をしておいていただけますかな","So, looking for people to take 
on the construction work...
Could you discuss the request with them?","","Barton"
"自室の工事をする人員を
探していらっしゃるんですか？","Are you looking for workers to
renovate your room?","","Man"
"普段お世話になってる覚者さまのために
ここは一肌脱がなきゃいけませんね！
さっそく現場に向かって作業開始しましょう","We can't just stand by when it's for Ser Arisen, 
you've always looked after us!
We'll head to the site and get started right away.","","Man"
"改築作業に向いたヤツがいないかって？
覚者さんのためなら、俺が手伝うよ！
力仕事なら任せてくれ","You need someone for renovation work?
For the Arisen, I'll lend my strength!
Leave the heavy lifting to me.","","Man"
"自室を改築するんですって？
細かい作業もあるでしょうから、お手伝いするわ
手先の器用さにはちょっと自信があるの","Renovating your private quarters, I hear?
There must be delicate 
work involved, so I'll help.
I'm quite confident in my dexterity.","","Woman"
"作業、もう始めてますよ
この分だともうすぐ終わりそうです――
<NPC 1024>さんにもそうお伝えください","The work has already begun.
At this rate, it should be done soon--
Please relay that to <NPC 1024> as well.","","Man"
"なかなか良い出来になるんじゃないでしょうか
まぁ、完成を楽しみにしておいてください","It's shaping up quite nicely.
Well, look forward to the finished product.","","Man"
"覚者さんにはいつも世話になってるからさ
いつか恩返しがしたいと思ってたんだ
こうして手伝えてよかったよ","You've always looked after me, so
I've been wanting to repay the favor.
I'm glad I can help like this.","","Man"
"力仕事はできないけど
細かい仕上げは得意なのよね
きれいに作ってみせるわ","I'm not good at heavy labor,
but I excel at delicate finishing work.
I'll make sure it turns out beautifully.","","Woman"
"無事に作業完了できたようですね
改築された自室で快適にお過ごしください","The work has been completed without issue.
May you enjoy your newly 
renovated private quarters.","","Barton"
"作業を頼まれたと思ったら
覚者の部屋の工事か
いや、引き受けたことはやり遂げるがな","The job you need done is construction
in the Arisen's room?
Didn't expect that, but we'll
finish what we started.","","White Knight"
"まぁ、非番だったし――
何よりバートンの頼みだ
ここは気持ちよく作業完了といくか","Well, I was off duty anyway--
And more importantly, it's Barton's request.
Might as well finish the job in good spirits.","","White Knight"
"こういった作業もやり始めると楽しいもんだな
――ちょっと集中したいんだ
今は話しかけないでくれ","Once you get into this kind of work, 
it's actually fun.
--But, I need to focus right now.
Don't talk to me for a bit.","","White Knight"
"今回の工事作業は騎士団の方々が
引き受けてくださることになっています
作業完了まで、しばらくお待ちください","The knights have agreed to handle
the construction work this time.
Please wait a while for its completion.","","Barton"
"改築作業が無事完了しましたぞ","The renovation work has been 
completed successfully.","","Barton"
