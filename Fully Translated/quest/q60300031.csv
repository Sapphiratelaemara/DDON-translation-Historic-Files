"覚者様のおかげで城も取り戻せたし
この通り、よろず屋も
再開できるまでになりました","Thanks to Ser Arisen, we've reclaimed the
castle, and as you can see, the General Shop
has reopened for business.","","Isetto"
"みんな日々の暮らしを取り戻しつつあるんですが――
実は、この城を占領していた残党が
まだいるようなんです！","People are gradually returning to their daily
lives, but... Remnants of the forces
that occupied this castle still remain!","","Isetto"
"なんでも、城外の防衛区画に籠城してるとか――
ここもいつまた攻め込まれるか分からない状況で
“完全奪還”とは言い難いかもしれません","They're holed up in the defensive area
outside the walls—
We can't say we've fully
retaken the castle while they're still there.","","Isetto"
"こんな時、参謀官のソネル様がいれば
真っ先に作戦を立てて、電光石火で
城外も奪還してる頃なんでしょうけど――","If Chief Strategist Sonel were here, he'd
have a plan ready in no time and retake the
area outside the walls in a flash...","","Isetto"
"聞いた話によると
展望城が魔軍に奪われた時に
地下牢に幽閉されたとか――","I heard that when the Demon Army took
Lookout Castle, he was imprisoned in
the dungeon—","","Isetto"
"それならもう出てきてもいい頃だと思いませんか？
もしかして、何かあったんでしょうか","Don't you think it's about time he showed up?
I wonder if something happened to him.","","Isetto"
"ああ、ソネル様は解放軍の参謀官なんですよ
奇抜な作戦を立てる方で――
“一周まわり過ぎた天才”と言われるほどです","Ah, Ser Sonel is the Liberation Army's chief
strategist. He comes up with unconventional
plans—they call him a 
'genius who goes above and beyond.'","","Isetto"
"城外の奪還をするなら
欠かせない存在のはずなんですが――
地下牢へ行くことがあれば
様子を見てきてもらえませんか？","He's indispensable for retaking the area
outside the walls...
If you happen to go to the
dungeon, could you check on him?","","Isetto"
"だれ！？　敵？　味方？
いや、どっちでもいい、慌てないで――
まずボクの話を聞いてほしい","Who's there? Friend or foe?
Doesn't matter - stay calm! 
Just... hear me out first.","","Sonel"
"いや――、キミは――だれ？
見たところオークではないようだけど――
ひょっとしてボクを助けに来てくれたのかい！？","Wait... who are you? 
You don't look like an orc—
did you come to rescue me!?","","Sonel"
"展望城が魔軍の襲撃を受けて
兵たちと城内で抵抗を続けていたんだけど
突如、邪悪な目が現れ、そこからはもう――","Lookout Castle was under attack by the Demon Army,
and our soldiers kept holding out within the walls.
But suddenly, an Evil Eye appeared, and then...","","Sonel"
"とにかく！
ここからボクを連れ出してくれないか！？
ちゃんとお礼はするとも！","Anyway! Can you get me out of here!?
I'll make it worth your while!","","Sonel"
"だれ！？　敵？　味方？
いや、どっちでもいい、慌てないで――
まずボクの話を――","Who's there? Friend or foe?
Doesn't matter - stay calm!
Just... hear me out first.","","Sonel"
"え？
その話はさっきも聞いたって？","Huh? You heard this story already?","","Sonel"
"おかしいな、だいたいの奴は
２回目が始まった途端
溜息交じりにこの場を去るのだが","Strange. Most people leave with a sigh as
soon as I start repeating myself.","","Sonel"
"誰が信用できるか分からないからね
まずは支離死滅なことを言って
試してみてたんだ","I couldn't tell who to trust,
so I start by saying random things
to test the waters.","","Sonel"
"――で、このボクに何か用かな？","... So, what do you want with me?","","Sonel"
"城外が敵に占領されている","The area outside the walls is still occupied.","","Sonel"
"牢屋を間違えた","I got the wrong cell.","","Sonel"
"ふむふむ――
この城を占領していた魔軍の残党が
未だ城外で籠城していると","Hmm... 
So, remnants of the Demon Army that
occupied this castle are still holed up outside
the walls.","","Sonel"
"――よし、わかった","—Got it.","","Sonel"
"どうやら、ここはボクの――
“天才的作戦”が必要なようだね","Seems like this calls for one of my
'brilliant strategies.'","","Sonel"
"そろそろキノコメインの食生活にも
飽きて来たところだ","I was getting tired of a mushroom-based diet
anyway.","","Sonel"
"ボクの仕事場――
この城の最上部、《王宮層》に戻るとするよ","I'll return to my workplace―
The top floor of this castle, 
the Royal Palace layer.","","Sonel"
"そうだ――
キミも後で顔を出してくれ","Right—
come see me later.","","Sonel"
"そう！　その通りだ！
キミ、なかなか話せるね！","Yes! That's right!
You're quite the talker!","","Sonel"
"気に入ったよ！
また、ボクと話したくなったら
ここへ来てくれたまえ","I like you! If you ever want to talk again,
come back here.","","Sonel"
"そうか、ソネル様復帰されたのか！
これで、城外の奪還も夢じゃないな！","Ser Sonel's back!? Retaking the area outside the
walls isn't just a dream anymore!","","Isetto"
"解放軍にとって、いいニュース続きでうれしいよ
とにかくありがとう！","It's great news after great news for the 
Liberation Army. Thank you so much!","","Isetto"
"おいおい、そんなすぐにここから出られると
思わないでくれよ！","Hey, don't think I'm leaving this place so soon!","","Sonel"
"世話になったキノコくんたちにも
お別れを言わないといけないんだ","I have to say goodbye to the mushrooms 
that took care of me.","","Sonel"
"まぁ、ほとんど残ってないんだけどね！","Well, there's hardly any left though!","","Sonel"
"支度を済ませたら
この城の最上部、《王宮層》に戻るから
キミも後で顔を出してくれ","Once I'm ready, I'll return to the top floor of
this castle, the Royal Palace layer. 
Come see me later.","","Sonel"
"あぁ、キミは確か――鉄格子の！
間に何もない会話って新鮮だね！","Oh right—the one on the other side of the bars! 
So novel talking without separation!","","Sonel"
"ここはボクの“仕事場”みたいなもんさ
なんてったって、参謀官だからね","This is like my ""workspace.""
After all, I'm a staff officer.","","Sonel"
"しかも！　作戦を立てるだけじゃなく
実際に戦っちゃうのがボクの流儀だ
こう見えて、ソーサラーなのでね","Not only that! It's my style to not just make
plans but actually fight. 
Despite appearances,
I'm a Sorcerer, you see.","","Sonel"
"ボクがひとたび杖をかざせば
“作戦が火を噴く”――
ということで有名さ","Once I raise my staff,
""the operation catches fire""—
that's what I'm famous for.","","Sonel"
"あっ","Oh.","","Sonel"
"あっはっ","Ah, ha.","","Sonel"
"あっはっはっ","Ahahaha!","","Sonel"
"あっはっはっは！","Ahahaha!","","Sonel"
"さてと、城外は魔軍に占領されたままだ
さっそく奪還に取り掛からないとね","Now then, the area outside the walls is
still occupied by the Demon Army. We must
start reclaiming it right away.","","Sonel"
"ひとつ――“いいこと”を思いついたんだ
それを聞いてもらいたくってね
だからキミをここへ呼んだのさ","I've come up with a ""good idea."" 
I wanted you to hear it, 
so that's why I called you here.","","Sonel"
