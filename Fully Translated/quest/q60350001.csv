このままでは白竜様の身に

Lord White Dragon will be in danger.","","Isaac"
"このままでは白竜様が危険に――
何だって？　断られるとは思わなかったな
今のは――覚者が何のための存在であるか
考え抜いた上での答えか？","If this continues, Lord White Dragon
will be in danger... What? I didn't expect
to be refused. Have you carefully considered
what it means to be Arisen?","","Isaac"
"いいか、よく聞くんだ
以前にもこの白竜神殿を襲撃した
黒竜の覚者――
その姿が再び確認されたらしい","Listen carefully. The Arisen of the
Black Dragon, who once attacked The
White Dragon Temple, has reportedly
been sighted again.","","Isaac"

お前がヤツを倒したことは
レスタニアの人間なら誰でも知ってるさ","Now, don't get me wrong. Everyone in

"今回現れたのはその力の残滓、いわゆる“思念体”だ
元々が強大な力を持っていたがゆえに
思念体の域を超え、実体として
よみがえったかのようにふるまっているらしい","What appeared this time is a remnant of
their power, a ""phantom"" or some such.
As a being who previously wielded great
power, it seems to have manifested itself
in our world, as if it has been revived.","","Isaac"
"ヤツにとって最後の機会になるよう
粉々に打ち砕いてやれ","Make sure this is its last chance.
Crush it.","","Isaac"
"俺たちが竜の統べる世界に存在する以上
白竜様に再び危険が及ぶ可能性は
徹底的に排除しなきゃならん","As long as we exist in a world ruled by Dragons,
we must thoroughly eliminate any possibility
of danger coming to Lord White Dragon.","","Isaac"
