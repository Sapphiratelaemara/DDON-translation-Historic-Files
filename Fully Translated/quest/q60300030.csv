"一度魔軍の手に落ちたティネス砦を
奪還できたのは非常に喜ばしい――
が、オークどもに荒らされた箇所の修繕は
なかなか骨が折れますな","It brings me great joy that we managed to
recapture Fort Thines from the Demon Army’s
clutches -- but repairing the damage inflicted
by those orcs is proving to be quite arduous.","","Zeki"
"そういえば、荒らされた《<STG 448>》で
女の子が真っ青な顔でうずくまっていました
手を貸したかったのですが、あいにく
私も手一杯でして――","Speaking of which, in the ransacked 
<STG 448>,
I saw a girl was crouching, 
all color gone from her face.
I wanted to help, but unfortunately
was swamped myself...","","Zeki"
"覚者さま、一度様子を見にいって
やっていただけませんか？","Master Arisen, could you go and
check on her for me?","","Zeki"
"《<STG 448>》もひどく荒らされてまして
女の子が真っ青な顔でうずくまっていました
何やら思いつめたような雰囲気で――","<STG 448> was badly damaged, 
and I spotted a girl hiding, 
with her face all pale.
She had an intense, desperate aura about her...","","Zeki"
"覚者さま、一度様子を見にいって
やっていただけませんか？","Master Arisen, could you go and
check on her for me?","","Zeki"
"も、もうダメ――
どこを探しても食料が無い――","I... I can't go on...
There's no food left anywhere...","","Carrie"
"いくら砦を取り戻せても、
食べる物が無くなれば、みんな飢えて終わり","No matter how many fortresses we retake,
if we run out of food, everyone will starve.","","Carrie"
"アタシもここに居られなくなったら
荒野をさすらって雑草を食べる生活に逆戻りだ","If I have to leave here, I'll be back
to wandering the wilderness, 
eating weeds.","","Carrie"
"どうにかしなきゃいけないけど
どうしたらいいのかわからないよ――","I have to do something, but...
I don't know what...","","Carrie"
"ほんの少しの食料すら無い
お鍋も、テーブルも、椅子も
全部壊されちゃってる――","There's not even a scrap of food left.
The pots, tables, chairs.
Everything's been destroyed...","","Carrie"
"戦士でも大工でもないアタシに
一体何ができるんだろう――","What can someone like me do...
I'm not a warrior, nor a carpenter...","","Carrie"
"声をかける","Greet","","Carrie"
"そっとしておく","Keep silent","","Carrie"
"――ああ、もしかして
食事に来た人？","-- Oh, are you maybe...
Someone who came for a meal?","","Carrie"
"ここ、大食堂のはずだったんだけど
この通り――がれきの山になっちゃって――","This was supposed to be the Great Dining Hall,
but as you can see, 
it’s just a pile of debris...","","Carrie"
"こんなんじゃ料理もできないから
たき火に木片を投げ入れては
燃えるのを眺めてるの――","I can't cook like this, so I just
throw wood scraps into the fire and
watch them burn...","","Carrie"
"そうしてるとね――
思い出すんだ
以前の――あの楽しかった日々を――","Doing that... makes me remember.
The happy days we had before—","","Carrie"
"――考えないと
アタシがここを元通り修理するのに
何か月かかるんだろう","... I don't even want to think
about how many months it would take
for me to fix this place alone.","","Carrie"
"修理の材料と――
それから、食料を、調達するには――
砦には、何もないのに――","Materials for repairs... Food... 
How am I supposed to get them?
The fort has nothing left—","","Carrie"
"様子はどうでしたか？
――そうですか
相当滅入ってるようですな","How was she?
—I see. She seems quite despondent.","","Zeki"
"この砦を奪還してからと言うもの
大食堂に閉じこもったまま
ずっとああなのです――","Ever since we retook the fort,
she's been holed up in the Great Dining Hall
like that...","","Zeki"
"毎日、少しだけでも構わないので
彼女の話を聞いてやってはもらえませんかね？","Could you spare a moment each day,
if only to listen to her?","","Zeki"
"食料を調達して、料理して
それからここでみんなに食べてもらえるように
テーブルや椅子なんかも修理して――","Gather food, cook it, then fix
tables and chairs so everyone
can eat here properly...","","Carrie"
"やらなきゃいけないことはわかってる
でも――アタシにできるかは――","I know what I have to do, but...
Can I really do it...","","Carrie"
"――え？
何か力になれることはないかって？","... Huh? You want to know
if there's anything you can do to help?","","Carrie"
"アタシを――
この大食堂を、助けてくれるの――？","You'd... help me?
With this dining hall?","","Carrie"
"ほ、本当に！？
夢でも見てるみたい
本当に、頼りにしちゃっていいのね？","W-wait, really!?
It feels like I'm dreaming.
So I can really count on you?","","Carrie"
"あ――いけない
また、思い出にふけっちゃった――","Ah—I shouldn't...
I got lost in my memories again...","","Carrie"
"ずっとこうしていたって
なんにも元に戻らないのは分かってるんだ――","I know sitting here won't
bring anything back to how it was...","","Carrie"
"でも、アタシ一人の力だけじゃどうにも――","But I can't do it all by myself...","","Carrie"
