"おや、なんでしょう？
この私を見て、声をかけずには
いられなかったと――？
そのお気持ち、理解できますとも","Oh, what is it?
You saw me and couldn't help but say hello to me?
I can understand why you would feel that way."
"ごきげんよう、覚者殿
本日も良き旅を――","Good day, Lord Arisen.
Have a good trip today--"
"我が主はいずこへ？
全く、この私を置いてゆくとは――","Where is my master?
How dare you leave me?"
"この世には様々な覚者殿がいらっしゃるのですね
それぞれに色があり――
それぞれに美しい","There are so many different kinds of Arisen in this world.
Each has its own color.
Each beautiful in its own way."
"この荘厳な拠点は悪くありませんが――
ささやかながら居心地の良い主の自室も
私は好きですよ","This majestic base is not bad--
but I also like the Lord's own room, which is cozy in its own small way!"
