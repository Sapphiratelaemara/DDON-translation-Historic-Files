"こんにちは！
ねぇねぇ、ぼくと冒険行こうよー！","Hello!
Hey, hey, let's go on an adventure!"
"怪我をしてほしくないのは、
覚者さまもポーンも同じ――
今日も気をつけて、行ってきてくださいね！","I don't want you to get injured,
The Arisen and the pawn are the same...
Please be careful when you go today!"
"ぼくとぼくの覚者さまを、
これからも末永くよろしくおねがいします！","Me and my master,
We look forward to your continued support!"
"なんですか？　もしかして、ぼくと冒険に行きたい？
うーん、知らない人について行っちゃダメだしなぁ
――なんてね！","What is it? Maybe you want to go on an adventure with me?
Well, you shouldn't follow people you don't know.
--Oh my goodness!"
"クラン拠点って大きいね！
いいなぁ、ぼくの覚者さまの部屋も
これくらいあればなぁ","I wish I had a clan base like this!
If only my master's room was as big as this."
