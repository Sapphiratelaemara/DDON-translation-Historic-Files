"CYCLE_QUEST_INFO_61ex1","火垂れ山にて、ネド王子と白竜の覚者により滅ぼされた
悪しき竜だったが、四散した禍々しき竜力は
大地の浄化の流れに背くように山の不滅の炎と結び
つき、再び絶望を吐き散らす竜の姿となり動き出した
蘇った悪しき竜を討ち破り、つなぎ止めた希望を
死守せよ！","At Firefall Mountain, the evil dragon, who was destroyed by Prince Nedo and the Arisen of the White Dragon, has arisen again. The malevolent dragon power that scattered has merged with the everlasting flame of the mountain, going against the flow of the earth's purification, and has taken on the form of a dragon once again, spewing despair. Defeat the revived evil dragon and protect the hope that has been bound and preserved!"
