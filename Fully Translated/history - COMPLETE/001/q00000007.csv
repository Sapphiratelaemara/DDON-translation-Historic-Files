"HISTORY_STEP_33","　白竜の前に集う覚者のひとりであるイリスの様子が
気にかかる

　よく笑う娘で時に気に触るほどだった。だが、アー
クの調査から帰還してからはまるで気性が変わってし
まったかのようだ

　このところ姿を消していたのはキノザの鉱泉へ行っ
ていたためらしい。案じたクラウスが人を送って連れ
戻したが、はて、やはり、どこか以前とは違う気がし
てならない

　危うさを感じているのはわたしだけではないはず
だ。覚者は心臓を竜に預けている。心臓と情の動きは
密接に関係しているはずだ。胸に空虚を抱える覚者に
精神的な落ち着きを期待するのは間違っているのだろ
うか

　さて、クラウスにも問題がある。アークの調査報告
執筆に加えて、レオから古文書の解析も依頼されてい
るはず。加えて他人の心配

　これではすべてが中途半端なままだ。未熟故に時間
の案配がわからないのだろう。指導の必要がありそう
だ","I am concerned about the appearance of Iris, one of the Arisen who has gathered before the White Dragon.

She used to be a cheerful girl who would sometimes irritate people. However, ever since returning from the Ark investigation, it seems like her temperament has completely changed.

It seems that she had been disappearring because she went to the Kinoza hot springs. Klaus, who was worried, sent someone to bring her back. Yet, I can't help but feel something is different compared to before.

I am not the only one who feels this uneasiness. The Arisen entrust their hearts to the dragon. The movement of their heart and emotions should be closely related. Is it wrong to expect emotional stability from the Arisen who carry an emptiness in their chest?

Now, Klaus also has a problem. In addition to writing a report on the Ark investigation, he was also asked by Leo to analyze ancient documents. In addition to worrying about others.

Everything remains unfinished like this. Perhaps they don't understand how to manage their time due to their immaturity. It seems that guidance is necessary."
