　ガラダの回復が待たれる","It turned out that a very precious substance called a Primeval Drop was needed to restore the core tree. Brave Gearóid and a group of volunteers managed to acquire it, but an incident occurred where they were attacked and the drops were taken by someone.

I heard that Gearóid was seriously injured in the attack, and three others who were with him lost their lives. Judging by their wounds, it seems that they were attacked by enemies, but I wonder if those enemies were the ones who took the Primeval Drops.

We are all waiting for Gearóid's recovery."
