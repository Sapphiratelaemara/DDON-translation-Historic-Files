"HISTORY_STEP_46","　メイリーフが世話になったエルフの青年（名はキー
スヒルト）が死んだ

　レオたちが救出に向かったが間に合わなかったの
だ。レスタニアの智がこうむった損失は計り知れな
い

　長命のエルフが身のうちに蓄えた記憶は、そのまま
レスタニアの歴史であったはずだ。いつかじっくり話
を聞きたいと思っていたが叶わず。無念としか言いよ
うがない

また、報告によればキースヒルトの命は敵の手で器に
納められ、持ち去られた

　敵がメイリーフを執拗に狙った理由、あっさりと標
的をメイリーフからキースヒルトに切り替えた理由が
わかるというものだ

　彼らの目的はやはり命。長命のエルフの命が持つ力
は、我々の命の比ではないはずだ。して、その命を奴
らは何に使うのか。判明してからでは遅い、奪還の可
能性を模索することが急務だ","Mayleaf was taken care of by a young elf man named Kieshildt who has now died. Leo and the others went to rescue him but didn't make it in time.

The loss suffered by Lestania's wisdom is immeasurable. The memories that the long-lived Elf had accumulated within him were supposed to be the history of Lestania. I had hoped to listen to them carefully someday, but that wish couldn't come true. It's nothing but regret. 

According to the report, Kieshildt's life was taken away by the enemy and taken with them. The reason the enemy persistently targeted Mayleaf and easily switched targets from Mayleaf to Kieshildt is understood. 

Their purpose is indeed life. The power that the long-lived Elf's life possesses is beyond comparison to our own lives. Therefore, it is urgent to explore the possibility of recovery before it becomes clear how they will use that life."
