“手記と思われる紙の切れ端が落ちている”,"""Scraps of a paper note seem to have fallen down."""
“塔”とは一体、どこにあるのだろう？,"This ""Tower"" of his, where the heck is it?"
"用心深い彼のことだ、たやすく見つかる場所に
あるとは思っていないが――
日記によると、全てをそこに置いてきたのだとか","He's very cautious, so I don't think he's in a place
that can be easily found...
According to the diary, he says everything has been placed there?"
"「全て」がすなわち宝を意味するならば
盗賊を警戒して巧妙に隠す意図も理解できる
――物に執着があるとは、少々意外だったが","If by everyhing he means ""treasure"",
you can understand his intention to hide it from any would-be thieves.
...It's still a bit surprising that there is an obsessed with such
things though."
"とはいえ、彼の足取りを順に追っていけば
いつかは“塔”に辿り着くだろう","Nevertheless, if we retrace his steps
we will arrive at the tower in due time."
"彼が命尽きる時まで追い求めた宝――
その遺志を継ぎ、形にして納めることで
彼と私、お互いにとって良い弔いになるはずだ","The treasure that he had chased after until the time of his death...
By carrying on his will, and shaping it, both he and I, will have lavish funerals."
