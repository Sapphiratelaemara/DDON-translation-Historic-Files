"600年ほど前に建造された砦
アッカー家が並み居る地方豪族を倒して
大陸統一を果たした後に、対オーク用に強化されて
現在に至る。長く役目を果たしていたが“悪しき竜”
出現直後にオーク軍に占拠された","A fort that was built about 600 years ago. 
After the Acre family defeated the local feudal lords, they strengthened it to fend off the Orcs and it has remained that way to this day. 
It had served its purpose for a long time, but was occupied by the Orc army shortly after the appearance of the ""Evil Dragon."""
"解放軍が拠点として使っている小さな集落
元はきこりが使っていたらしき空き家を中心に、
逃げ延びた人たちがテントを張って暮らしているが
いつオークに攻め込まれるかわからない状況にある","The small settlement used as a base by the Liberation Army.
It originally consisted of vacant houses, seemingly once occupied by lumberjacks. 
Now, people who managed to escape have pitched tents and are living there, constantly facing the uncertainty of when they will be attacked by Orcs."
"翡翠湖を臨む、長くロスギル家が治める地方の中心地
魔物が多い地帯ならではの重装家屋が見られる
王族アッカー家から一帯の守護を任されてきた
ロスギル家の末裔を長に頂き、忠誠心に篤い人々が
暮らしている","Overlooking Emerald Lake, in the heart of a region long ruled by the Rothgill family.
One can see the sturdy houses characteristic of this land abundant in enemies. 
Tasked with protecting the entire area by the noble Acre family, descendants of the Rothgill family serve as its leaders, with loyal and devoted individuals living here."
