Their combat style is to always maintain a safe position at medium to long range,
and perform ally recovery and support through magic, as well as auxiliary attacks."

The ability to efficiently heal oneself and allies is crucial for achieving victory. 

Additionally, utilizing Heal Aura to detect the weak points of large enemies and triggering their ""Secret Core Manifestation"" is a vital responsibility of a Priest.
It is important to provide the most appropriate support that aligns with the current battle situation in order to effectively support and uplift everyone."
