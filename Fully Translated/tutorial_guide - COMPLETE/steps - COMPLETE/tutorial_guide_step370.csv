"TUTORIAL_STEP_650"	"戦甲に有効となる主な攻撃方法は以下の２通りです 　１．吹き飛ばし力が高い攻撃 　２．仲間と協力して集中攻撃仲間との集中攻撃に成功すると一定時間、赤いヒビがさらに赤く光り戦甲をより破壊しやすい状態になります"	"The main attack methods effective against the War Ready are as follows: 

1. Attacks with high Blow Power 
2. Concentrated attacks with teammates

If a concentrated attack with teammates is successful, the red cracks will shine even brighter, making it easier to destroy the War Ready for a certain period of time."	""	""	""	""	""	""	""	""	""
