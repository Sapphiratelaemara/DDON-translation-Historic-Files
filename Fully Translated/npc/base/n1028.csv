"世の中には、それぞれの道を究めた
職の達人たちがいるらしい","It seems that there are
masters of their craft who have mastered their respective paths in the world."
"そういった達人は《ジョブマスター》と呼ばれ
一般的に使われる戦技以上の技を
使いこなすという","Those experts are called ""job masters"".
They are skilled in techniques above and beyond
the standard battle techniques."
"もっとも、まずは基礎からだ
中級の技を軽々と扱えるほどにならなければ
縁のない話だぞ","Of course, the basics come first.
If you do not become comfortable with the intermediate techniques
you will get nowhere."
"そうだな、彼らに技を習うのであれば
レベル18が目安といったところだ","Yes, if you want to learn skills from them,
I'd say you should be level 18."
"魔物にはそれぞれ弱点があり
適した技やチャンスがある
敵と己を知れば、百戦あやうからずだ！","Monsters each have their own weaknesses,
so use suitable skills and don't miss opportunities.
If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles!"
"魔物に対抗する技を磨くのは
騎士団も覚者も同じ
つまらん諍いは俺には関係ないな","It's the same for both the knights and the Arisen
to hone their skills against demons
Boring quarrels are none of my business."
"鍛えているか？
自身の技と経験こそ、何よりの武器だぞ","Do you train?
Your own skill and experience are your best weapons."
"おお、覚者よ
戦技の習得か、それとも職変えか
用件を聞こう","Oh, Arisen,
learning the art of war or changing careers
let's hear what you have to say."
"おお、覚者よ
状況が状況だ――戦技にしろ、職にしろ
万全の状態にしておくことだ","Oh, Arisen,
the situation is the situation--whether it's a war skill or a job
make sure you're in top shape!"
"恐れる必要はない
今まで鍛えてきた成果を発揮する時だと
大きく構えることだ","Don't be afraid
it's time to show what you've been working out
and take a big stand!"
"萎縮しては技も鈍ろう
これまでの経験がお前の何よりの武器だ","Atrophy will dull your skills.
Your experience so far is your best weapon."
"覚者や騎士、一部の神殿関係者以外には
まだ詳しいことは知らされていない
混乱を招きかねないというジョゼフ神官の判断だ","No one other than sentient beings, knights, and some temple officials
have been informed of the details yet.
Priest Joseph's decision that it could be confusing."
