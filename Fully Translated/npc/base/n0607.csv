"old",""
"やあ、あんたが白き竜の覚者さんか","Hey, are you the Arisen of the White Dragon?"
"このほこらに分散している
私の力を集めて
ここまで持ってきてくれないかい？","Can you gather the power scattered at this shrine and bring it here?"
"そうすれば、あんたに力を貸してやれる――
何せ今は何の力も無くってね","If you do that, then I can lend you my strength—after all, I don't have any power right now."
"ありがとう、よく集めてきたね
おかげで何かといい感じだよ","Thanks, you've done a great job collecting them.
It's made me feel like I'm on to something."
"見たところ、あんたなら
もっと深くまで潜ることもできそうだし――","From what I can see, you could probably delve even deeper -"
"さぁ、見てな
土砂ごとき、力さえ戻ればこんなもんさ","Now, look here.
Just some earth and sand.
If only I regain my strength, it's nothing."
"どうだい？
土砂をどけて、道を作っておいたよ
これで先に進めるだろう","How about it?
I cleared away the debris and made a path.
You should be able to proceed now."
"あんたほどの実力があるなら
この先に眠る宝物にもたどり着けるんじゃない？","If you're as good as you say you are,
you'll get to the treasures that lie ahead, won't you?"
"期待してるよ――
ああ、久しぶりに楽しかった","I'm counting on you— Ah, I haven't had this much fun in a while."
"すまないけど、思ったより
土砂が詰まっててね
さすがに時間がかかってしまってるんだ","Sorry, it's more
packed with sediment than I thought.
It's taking longer than expected."
"もう少しだけ時間をくれない？
なに、目途は立ってるからさ","Can you give me a little more time?
No, I've got a plan."
"ふふふ、そう怪訝な顔をしないで
あんたの力になりたいだけさ","Hahaha, don't make such a bewildered face.
I just want to support you."
"まだ王子は幼いんだろ？
そうそう、ネド王子――","The prince is still young, right? Yes, Prince Nedo—"
"そう気を遣わなくていいさ
私だってそんな大層な人間じゃないからさ
昔ね、腕っぷしが強かっただけだよ――ハハハ","You don't have to worry about it,
because I'm not that extraordinary either.
In the past, it was just that I was strong physically - Hahaha."
"あれ、あんたの仲間は
すでに道を拓いてるんじゃない？","Oh, your companions, aren't they already carving their own path?"
"これなら仲間の力をたどって
一時的に道を開くことができそうだよ","If you follow the power of your companions
you may be able to temporarily open the path"
"通常開拓する","Explore normally."
"仲間の力をたどる","Follow the power of your companion"
