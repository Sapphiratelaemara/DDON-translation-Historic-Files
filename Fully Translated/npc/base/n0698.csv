"あたしの仕事かい？
情報屋、古道具屋、胴元――
数えだしたらキリが無いねェ","My job? Informer, antique dealer, bookmaker— the list goes on and on."
"ま、どれも趣味でやっているもんだがね
このメガドの夜の住人と触れあうのは
結構楽しいもんさ","Well, it's all just a hobby for me, but it's quite fun to interact with the nocturnal residents of Megado."
"あぁ、施しはいらないよ
あいにく、暮らすのに困らないくらいは
稼いでるんだ","Ah, I don't need charity.
Unfortunately, I earn enough to live comfortably."

見くびられやすい格好の方が
情報は集めやすいもんなのさ","I dress this way because it's good for business.
It's easier to gather information when you're easily underestimated."

その代わり、あたしやメフィスみたいなはぐれ者は

Instead, outcasts like me and Mephis are relegated to the corner."
"そうなったのは、10年くらい前からさね","That has been the case since around 10 years ago."
