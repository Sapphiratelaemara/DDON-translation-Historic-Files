"次の作戦は――こっちでいくか
いやいや、逆にあっちの方が――","The next strategy is...shall we go this way... No, the other way around is better..."
"ボクは、よく独り言を言ってるらしいんだけど
みんなが言うほどの実感がなくってね","I often seem to be talking to myself, but I don't really feel it as much as everyone says."
"普段から、まわりに誰かいるかとかは
特に気にしてはいないけど
ボクにとっては自然なことさ","I usually don't pay much attention to whether someone is around me or not. It's just natural for me."
"――これは、独り言じゃないよね？","This isn't just talking to myself, right?"
"展望城に自分の部屋はないのかって？
ああ、それなら以前
一度作ってもらったことがあってね","Lookout Castle, isn't there a room for me there?
Ah, well, it's because I had one made before"
"でも、城内って広くて複雑でさ
部屋に戻るたびに迷うのに飽きてしまって
気が付いたら場所を忘れてたんだよ","But the castle is so big and complicated.
I got tired of getting lost every time I went back to my room and realized I'd forgotten where I was."
"今覚えてる場所は――
城の入り口と、王宮層と
あとはシチューのある食堂だけさ！","The only places I remember now are--
the castle entrance, the royal layer,
and the cafeteria with the stew!"
"ボクは、作戦というものは“生き物”だと思ってる","I think that a strategy is like a living creature."
"いくら事前に完璧に計画したつもりでも
その場の状況でいくらだって変わるし
思い通りに行く方が珍しいくらいさ","No matter how perfectly you plan it in advance, it can change at any moment, and it's rare that things go the way you want them to."
"まぁ、そこが面白いところなんだけどね
何でも思った通りになるなんて
つまんないだろ？","Well, that's the interesting part about it, you know? It's boring for everything to just go as you think."
"準備はいいかい？それじゃ行こう","Are you ready? Let's go."
"準備はいいかい？　それじゃ行こう","Are you ready?　Let's go."
"きっと、何かあるはずさ","There must be something for sure."
"きっと、何かあるはずさ","There must be something for sure."
"ふんふん、なるほどね","Hmmm... I see."
"いや、待てよ？","No, wait, could you?"
"いや、待てよ？","No, wait, could you?"
"そうか！　そういうことか！
やはり僕は、天才だね！","Ah, I see! So that's how it is! As I thought, I am a genius!"
"おかしいなぁ――
今日はちょっと調子が悪いらしい！","Hmm, that's strange... It seems like I'm feeling a little unwell today!"
"おかしいなぁ――
今日はちょっと調子が悪いらしい！","Hmm, that's strange... It seems like I'm feeling a little unwell today!"
"ほら、僕の思った通りだろう？","See, it's just as I thought, isn't it?"
"はっはっは！
たまにはこんなこともあるさ！","Hahaha! Sometimes things like this happen!"
"はっはっは！
たまにはこんなこともあるさ！","Hahaha! Sometimes things like this happen!"
"あー、キミキミ","Oh, you, you."
"あー、キミキミ","Oh, you, you."
"ちょっといいかな？　隊長","Can I have a word with you?　Captain."
"ちょっといいかな？　隊長","Can I have a word with you?　Captain."
"おかしいなぁ――","Hmm, something is strange."
"やはり僕は、天才だね！","I am a genius, after all!"
"それじゃあ行こう！","Let's go then!"
"ここにはもう何もなさそうだ","There doesn't seem to be anything here anymore."
"さて、帰るとしよう！","Now, let's go home!"
"ああ、もう――だめだ――","Oh, no—it's no use—"
"アハハハ！","Ahahaha!"
"アハハハ！","Ahahaha!"
"んんっ！？","Huh?!"
"んんっ！？","Huh?!"
"えぇっと――","Um..."
"はぁ～","Ha~"
"はぁ～","Ha~"
"あれ――","That—"
"ここにはもう何もなさそうだ
僕の勘がそう囁いているのでね
さて、帰るとしよう！","There doesn't seem to be anything else here. That's what my instincts are whispering to me, you know. Well, let's go home!"
"やったね！
僕らがいれば敵無しなんじゃないか！？","Great job! If we're together, we have no enemies, don't we?!"
"あー、ごめん
今ちょっと考えなきゃいけないことが
あってね、忙しいんだ","Oh, sorry. There's something I need to think about right now. I'm busy."
"ありがとう！　助かったよ！
よしよしこれで――","Thank you! I'm saved! Good job—"
"もう終わったの？
さすが、頼りになるね！","Is it already over? As expected, you're dependable!"
"さて、何をする？","Now, what to do?"
"さて、何をする？","Now, what to do?"
"やあ","Hey"
"やあ","Hey"
"よく来たね","Nice to see you"
"よく来たね","Nice to see you"
"はあはあ、久しぶりの戦は体に応えるなぁ","Ha ha! It's been a while since the last battle, it's taking a toll on my body"
"ちょっと待った、少し休憩させてくれ","Wait a moment, please let me take a short break."
"あれ、体が重いぞ、こんなはずじゃあ","Oh, my body feels heavy. This is not how it should be."
"や、やっぱり僕は室内で策を練ってる方が――","I think I'd rather be indoors, planning..."
"少しは、動けるようになってきたぞ――","I've become a little more mobile."
"ああ、でもまだ苦しい、ちょっと休憩","Ah, but I'm still hurting, I need a little break."
"キミから見て、今の僕ってどうかな？","How do I look now from your point of view?"
"もうちょっと頑張れそうな気も――ううん","I think I can do a little more -- no."
"あははは、どうだい僕の動き、軽やかだろう？","Ha-ha-ha, how's my movement, light, isn't it?"
"風のように走り、雷のように刺す！","Running like the wind, piercing like thunder!"
"なに、前はちょっと腕が鈍ってただけさ！","No, I was just a little rusty before!"
"ふふ、戦える参謀官っていいよね","Hehe, having a capable staff officer who can fight is nice, isn't it?"
"え、見つかった！？","Wait, it was found!?"
"さすが隊長だ！","As expected, Captain!"
