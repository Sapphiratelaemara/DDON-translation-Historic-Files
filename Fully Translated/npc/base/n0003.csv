今はどうかな――","Whether I am suitable to be a future priest--

I wonder now, how about it--",,Klaus
"逐次攻略というか各個撃破というか
物事はひとつずつ解決するのが良策だと
主張する人もいるけどね――","Rather than calling it a step-by-step strategy, it's more like defeating each individual. Some people argue that it's best to solve things one by one, but I'm not sure that it's a good idea.",,Klaus

(sigh)",,Klaus
"レオが匿っているという人と話せれば
もっと色々と分かるのだろうけど
今はそれよりも侵食魔退治だね

戦いは一段落ついたのかもしれないけど
調査は何も終わってないからね","I think I'll continue to investigate that island more thoroughly. Although the fighting may have come to a halt, the investigation is far from over.",,Klaus

かなり利己的な理由だけどね","I hope Loeg gets better soon.

There are so many things I don't know.
Being reminded of that...
Ah, it's frustrating.",,Klaus
"僕は君たちの一歩先のことを考えるとしよう
それが僕の仕事だよね？","Let's say I'm one step ahead of you guys
That's my job, right?",,Klaus
"あのゲートはフィンダムの竜の力が
生み出したものだ
僕らの心意気だけじゃどうにもならないよ","That gate is the result of the power of Phindym's dragon.
It can't be done with just our determination alone.",,Klaus

済んでいるのは、とてつもなく運が
いいのかもしれないね","If that's the case, it might be incredibly lucky that the chaos in Lestania has been settled to this extent.",,Klaus
"フィンダムを竜力が巡る仕組みは
こっちとは少し違うようだね",The mechanism of Dragon Force circulating around Phindym seems to be a little different from here.,,Klaus
"竜と樹が循環と浄化を分け合っているというか――
竜への異存が少ないということなのかなあ",I wonder if it means that the dragon and the tree are sharing circulation and purification - or maybe it means that there is little objection towards the dragon.,,Klaus
"聞くところによると、セシリーのお父さんは
戦士でもなんでもない、普通の人らしいね","According to what I've heard, Cecily's father is not a warrior or anything, he seems to be an ordinary person.",,Klaus

"さあ、みんなが待ってるよ？
君がなんとかしてくれる――
そう思っている連中も多いはずさ","Come on, the guys are waiting for you, okay?

I'm sure a lot of them think so.",,Klaus
"ロイグはガラダ族長たちのことを
快く思っていなかった
いや、逆恨みしていたという感じかな？","Loeg did not have a favorable opinion of the Gearóid tribal leaders.

入り込んだ――か",Did the Black Knight enter the dark depths of your heart?,,Klaus
"それにしてもあのロイグがね――
心根のいい奴に思えたけどなあ

後世に残そうと思っているんだけど――",I want to record what happened in Phindym and leave it for future generations to see--,,Klaus
