"ああ、ごめん
今は特に話すことはないよ","Oh, sorry
I don't really have anything to tell you right now."
"君と雑談？
いいね！　よし、共通の話題を探そうよ","Having a little chat with you?
Great!　Okay, let's find something we have in common."
"すまないけど、少し考えたいことがあるんだ
後で話そうよ","Sorry, I just have a few things to think about.
We can talk later."
"おや、疲れたのかい？
覚者も無敵ってわけじゃないんだな","Oh, you're tired, aren't you?
I guess even the Arisen aren't invincible."
"適材適所って言うだろ？
そう、僕は武ではなく、知で攻めるのさ","You know what they say about the right person for the right job?
Yes, I attack with wisdom, not military prowess."
"常識にとらわれないこと
それが、平凡を非凡に変えるんだ","Thinking outside the box 
That's what transforms ordinary into extraordinary"
"不安と期待が入り交じるこの気持ち――
説明が難しいね","This feeling of mixed anxiety and anticipation--
It's hard to explain."
"まだ読んでいない書物、まだ試していない実験――
心残りがあるうちは、死ねないよ","Books you haven't read yet, experiments you haven't tried yet--
You can't die while you have regrets."
"この世界は好きかい？
僕は好きだよ
知れば知るほど――もっと知りたくなる","Do you like this world?
I do.
The more you know-- the more you want to know."
"思い立ったら、すぐに行動！
待っていても発見は無いからね","When you have an idea, act on it immediately!
You won't find anything if you wait."
"ん？　どうしたんだい？","Hmm?　What's wrong?"
"やあ、新人さん
最初は誰彼かまわず顔を売っておくといいよ","Hello, new person. It's good to make yourself known to everyone at first, regardless of who they are."
"《ブラッドオーブ》のことは
常に気にしておくといいよ
見つけると確実に一目置かれるからね","It's good to always keep in mind about the 《Blood Orb》,
 because when you find it, you're sure to be admired."
"覚者と騎士団の反目に巻き込まれて
僕は処世術を学んだんだ","I learned the art of worldly wisdom
being caught up in the conflict between the Arisen and the knights."
"――と前向きに考えることにするよ
これも処世術と言えないこともないね","--I'm going to try to think positively
and this is another way to get by, I guess."
"――！？　ああ、ごめんごめん
ちょっと考え事をね","――!? Ah, sorry, sorry
I was just thinking about something"
"ジョゼフ様の助手になって以来初めての
大仕事を仰せつかって、その計画をね――
ふふふ――","Since becoming Joseph's assistant, this is the first big job I've been entrusted with, and I am now tasked with the planning... hehehe..."
"空から降ってきた巨大な石碑――","A gigantic stone monument fell from the sky..."
"まだ正体はわからないんだけど
どこかに落ちたらしいんだ
うわさか何か聞いてないかい？","I still do not know what it truly is, but
it seems to have fallen somewhere
Have you heard any rumors or something?"
"反省しています――はい
ああ、君か――また叱られるのかと思ったよ","I'm reflecting on it--yes.
Oh, it's you--I thought I was going to be scolded again."
"いや、君にも心配かけたよね
迎えに来てくれてありがとう
本当に感謝しているよ","No, I caused you to worry too, didn't I?
Thank you for coming to pick me up.
I really appreciate it."
"ごめん！
アークの調査報告が最優先でね
あちこち気が回らないんだよ","Sorry!
The Ark's investigation report is the top priority.
I can't focus on other things."
"アーク調査の報告書がまだだというのに
古文書の解読まで――","Despite the fact that the report on the Ark investigation is not yet complete, up until the deciphering of the ancient documents--"
"でも、君が持ち帰った古文書は面白そうで――
まずいな――ジョゼフ様に叱られるよ","But, the old document you took home seems interesting...
Uh-oh... I'm going to get scolded by Joseph, aren't I?"
"イリスとは話したかい？
なんだか避けられているような気が
しないでもないんだけど――","Did you talk to Iris?
I can't help but feel like she's avoiding me."
"もしかしたら、僕が覚者の力に
なれるのかもしれないな――","Perhaps, I may be able to become a powerful Arisen.."
"いささか――怖いね
でも、ほら、白竜様がお待ちだよ","It's a little scary―― but look, The White Dragon is waiting for you."
"どうだい？
覚者の生活には慣れたかな？","How about it?
Are you used to the life of an Arisen?"
"ちょうど君が覚者になった頃からこれまでとは
少し違う事件が起こるようになってきた
オークの活動が活発になったり――
ほら、アークの出現もそうだね","Since you became an Arisen, there have been different incidents occurring from before until now. 
The Orcs have become more active, and, well, the appearance of the Ark, too."
"そして、白竜様の回復を促す新しい方法も
見つかったみたいだ
これからも、もっと色々なことが
起こりそうな気がするよ","And it seems that a new method to encourage the recovery of The White Dragon has been found.
I feel like more things are going to happen from now on."
"メイリーフを連れ出したフードの女って
やっぱり彼女だよな――","The woman in the hood who took Mayleaf out...
I knew it was her."
"ディアマンテス――
イリスは確かにそう言ってたよね？","Diamantes - 
Iris did say that, right?"
"あははは――
こんなに神殿の近くが戦場になるなんて――
ああ、怖かった","Ahahaha――
Who would have thought that the area near the temple would turn into a battlefield――
Oh, how scary."
"さびしいね――
仲良くなれそうな気がしたんだけど――
いや、仲良かったよね――","It's lonely, isn't it...
I felt like we could become close...
No, we were close, right..."
"命は白竜様の役に立ったとしても
キースヒルトが知っていた知識、知恵――
全部消えてしまった","Even if the life was useful to Master White Dragon,
the knowledge, the wisdom that Keith Hilt knew--
it's all gone."
"やっぱり僕は生きているキースヒルトと
もっと話したかったよ――","I knew I wanted to talk more with Keith Hilt.
I just wish I could have told you more--"
"会議だなんて――
これは時間がかかるよ","A meeting? Oh, this is going to take some time."
"そんなことしている場合じゃないと思うけど
時間をもらえるのはありがたいことだから
僕は僕で独自に調べようと思っている","I don't think this is the time for that, but it's nice to have some time. I am thinking of researching on my own."
"まだ読み切れていない古文書もあるし
ここまで実際に体験したことを
評価し直す必要があるかもしれない","There are some ancient documents that have not yet been fully read, and I may need to reevaluate what I've actually done so far."
"僕も調査に行きたいんだよね――
でもここで騒ぐと余計に面倒な立場に
なってしまいそうだから我慢しているんだ","I want to go investigate too--
but I'm holding back because making a fuss here might put me in an even more troublesome position
"
"おかしいよ――
第一のアークの調査は僕が担当したんだ","That's strange--
I was in charge of investigating the first Ark."
"今度の調査だって僕が行けば前回との
比較ができたのに――
意見も全然聞いてもらえないし――はぁ","If I were to go on this investigation, I would have been able to compare it to the last time -- 
But I don't get listened to at all -- sigh."
"僕は確かに錬金術師の末裔さ
でも、だからなんだと言うんだろうね","I am indeed a descendant of an alchemist,
but so what?"
"僕のことはジョゼフ様が一番よく知っている
はずなのに――","You know me better than anyone, Joseph.
I should have known..."
"気づいていたのに――
イリスは少し変わったなって
気づいていたんだ","I had noticed--
that Iris had changed a little
"
"それなのに僕は――
悔やんでも悔やみきれないよ","And yet, I can't help but regret and regret."
"僕はね――もう後悔はしたくない
予兆には気づいていたのに――
遠慮する必要は何もなかったのに――","I don't--I don't want any more regrets.
I knew the signs were there.
There was no need to hesitate..."
"もう友達をなくすのは絶対に嫌だから
思ったことは口にするつもりだよ","I absolutely don't want to lose any more friends, so I intend to speak my mind."
"ここでジッとしてはいられない
僕もメルゴダへ行く！　絶対行く！","I can't stay still here. I'm going to Mergoda! I'm definitely going!"
"ディアマンテスに対抗する錬金術師が
ちゃんといたことがうれしくてね","I am happy that there was an alchemist who could oppose Diamantes."
"だから僕は、こっち側の人たちと神殿の
架け橋になろうと思うんだ","That's why I want to become a bridge between the people on this side and the temple."
"君も協力してくれるよね？
もう結構長い付き合いだもの――
僕に野心がないことなんてわかってるだろ？","You'll also help me, right?
We've been together for quite a long time, after all...
You know that I don't have any ambitions, don't you?"
"時は来た――だね","The time has come--right?"
"ずっと考えているんだけど――
ディアマンテスは僕が跡を継ぎたがるって
本気で考えたのかな――","I keep thinking--
that Diamantes wants me to follow in his footsteps.
Did he really think--?"
"だとしたら、哀れだね
出会ったばかりの僕しか後継者候補は
いないのか――ってさ","If that's the case, it's pitiful, isn't it?
Are there really no other candidates for the successor besides me, someone you just met?"
"嵐の中を出かけていった騎士たちには
頭が下がるよ","To the knights who went out into the storm,
I salute you"
"次は覚者の番だね
くれぐれも、気をつけて","Next is the turn of the Arisen,
Please be careful."
"悪いね
ついついレオのことを考えてしまうんだ
こんな時にどうして留守なんだってね","It's bad, isn't it?
I can't help but think about Leo.
Why is he absent at a time like this?"
"他の人も思いは同じだと思うよ
つまり――
僕が言いたいのは、レオの後任は大変だけど
頑張ってくれってことさ","I think other people feel the same way.
In other words--
What I want to say is, it's tough to be Leo's successor,
but I hope you will do your best."
"問題は、君とガルドリンが行ったという
島の場所だね","The problem is the location of the
island you and Gurdolin say you went to."
"レスタニア中の海図がこの神殿に
集まることになっているんだ
船乗りたちと一緒に、その海図とにらめっこさ","The charts of all of Lestania are to be gathered here in this temple.
I'll be poring over them with the sailors."
"大海原に浮かぶ島を見つけるなんて
そう簡単じゃない","It's not easy to find an island floating in the open sea."
"覚悟はしていたけどね――
いやいや、挫けてなるものか！","I was prepared, you know――
No, no, I will not be deterred!"
"島が見つかってホッとしているよ
肩の荷が下りたというかね
ここだけの話――
ジョゼフ様は僕を試しているね","I feel relieved that the island has been found.
It's like a burden has been lifted off my shoulders.
Just between you and me--
Master Joseph is testing me."
"将来の神官にふさわしいかどうか――
ノドから手が出るほど欲しい地位だったけど
今はどうかな――","Whether I am suitable to be a future priest--
Although I desired the position so much that I would give my right arm for it,
I wonder now, how about it--"
"逐次攻略というか各個撃破というか
物事はひとつずつ解決するのが良策だと
主張する人もいるけどね――","Rather than calling it a step-by-step strategy, it's more like defeating each individual. Some people argue that it's best to solve things one by one, but I'm not sure that it's a good idea."
"僕は混乱の中で解決を模索するのが好きなんだ
つまり、この慌ただしさも僕の味方さ","I enjoy seeking solutions in the midst of confusion.
In other words, this busyness is also on my side."
"島の調査は引き続きやっているよ
いい報告ができればいいんだけど
少々魔物が多くてね","We are still conducting investigations on the island.
I hope we can make a good report,
but there are quite a few monsters."
"騎士団が時々掃討作戦を展開しているから
まあ、気長にね――
ああ気長！　僕たちの苦手なやつだよね
くう――","Because the Knights sometimes conduct sweeps
Well, be patient--
Oh, patience!　We're not very good at that.
(sigh)"
"レオが匿っているという人と話せれば
もっと色々と分かるのだろうけど
今はそれよりも侵食魔退治だね
まったく、次から次へと――","If I could talk to the person Leo is hiding with, I would probably understand more. But right now, it's more about defeating the Corruption. Seriously, it's one thing after another--"
"例の島をね、もっとよく調べようと思うんだ
戦いは一段落ついたのかもしれないけど
調査は何も終わってないからね","I think I'll continue to investigate that island more thoroughly. Although the fighting may have come to a halt, the investigation is far from over."
"僕も島に乗り込みたいと思っていたけど
まだ時期尚早のようだね
もう少し状況が落ち着くのを待つよ","I also wanted to join you on the island, but it seems it's still too early.
I'll wait a little longer for the situation to settle down."
"島に現れた魔物はこれまでの侵食魔とは
かなり様子が違うとか？","I hear the monsters that appeared on the island are considerably different from the previous Corruption?"
"黒騎士と魔物の関係という観点から見ると
新手の方が、より黒騎士に近い存在という
ことかなあ","From the perspective of the relationship between the Black Knight and monsters, it could be said that the newcomer is a presence closer to the Black Knight."
"ロイグが早くよくなることを祈るよ
まあ、ロイグのためというよりは
かなり利己的な理由だけどね","I hope Loeg gets better soon.
Well, it's not so much for Loeg's sake
but rather for quite selfish reasons."
"あやふやとはいえ、ロイグの方が色々と
覚えているからね
その情報だけでも、ありがたいと思わなくちゃ","Even if uncertain, Loeg remembers various things, so I must be grateful for that information alone."
"セシリーは深手を負っている
致命傷がなければ命は助かるだろうけど
回復には長い時間がかかるよ","Cecily has suffered a serious injury. If there is no fatal wound, she should survive, but recovery will take a long time."
"まあ、今は生きのびてくれることを祈ろう","Well, let's pray that they'll survive."
"悔しいなあ
僕には知らないことがいっぱいある
それを思い知らされて――
ああ、悔しいよ","It's frustrating.
There are so many things I don't know.
Being reminded of that...
Ah, it's frustrating."
"僕は君たちの一歩先のことを考えるとしよう
それが僕の仕事だよね？","Let's say I'm one step ahead of you guys
That's my job, right?"
"あのゲートはフィンダムの竜の力が
生み出したものだ
僕らの心意気だけじゃどうにもならないよ","That gate is the result of the power of Phindym's dragon.
It can't be done with just our determination alone."
"ゲートの継続性について
もう少し確信が得られないと
僕は向こうへは行けないな","Regarding the sustainability of the gate,
I cannot go over there without a little more certainty."
"覚者じゃないこの身が恨めしいよ","This body that is not an Arisen is filled with resentment."
"ジョゼフ様の話を聞いていると
まるで僕たちがフィンダムへの侵略者のように
思えてくるよ","When listening to Joseph's story,
it feels as if we are invaders to Phindym."
"向こうとこっち――
立場は五分と五分――この考え方が
平和共存への道に繋がると思うんだ","Over there and here, 
The positions are evenly split—I believe that this way of thinking 
Leads to peaceful coexistence."
"よく考えると、このレスタニアでも
竜の不調は続いているわけだよね","When I think about it, even in this Lestania, the dragon's condition continues to worsen, doesn't it?"
"となると、レスタニアの混乱がこの程度で
済んでいるのは、とてつもなく運が
いいのかもしれないね","If that's the case, it might be incredibly lucky that the chaos in Lestania has been settled to this extent."
"フィンダムを竜力が巡る仕組みは
こっちとは少し違うようだね","The mechanism of Dragon Force circulating around Phindym seems to be a little different from here."
"竜と樹が循環と浄化を分け合っているというか――
竜への異存が少ないということなのかなあ","I wonder if it means that the dragon and the tree are sharing circulation and purification - or maybe it means that there is little objection towards the dragon."
"聞くところによると、セシリーのお父さんは
戦士でもなんでもない、普通の人らしいね","According to what I've heard, Cecily's father is not a warrior or anything, he seems to be an ordinary person."
"君だって、不安だろう？
早いところ、行った方がいいよ","You're worried, too, aren't you?
You'd better get there as soon as possible."
"さあ、みんなが待ってるよ？
君がなんとかしてくれる――
そう思っている連中も多いはずさ","Come on, the guys are waiting for you, okay?
You'll handle it--
I'm sure a lot of them think so."
"ロイグはガラダ族長たちのことを
快く思っていなかった
いや、逆恨みしていたという感じかな？","Loeg did not have a favorable opinion of the Gearóid tribal leaders.
No, it's more like he held a grudge against them, I guess?"
"その心の暗い部分に黒騎士が
入り込んだ――か","Did the Black Knight enter the dark depths of your heart?"
"それにしてもあのロイグがね――
心根のいい奴に思えたけどなあ
僕の人を見る目もまだまだだね","That Loeg, though...
He seemed like a good-hearted guy.
I still have a long way to go in judging people."
"回り道はあったけど、いよいよだね
良い報告を待っているよ","There was a detour, but now it's time.
I'll be waiting for good news!"
"浄化は始まっているんだろう？
進捗状況が気になるところだね","I assume the purification has begun?
I'm curious to see the progress."
"くれぐれも気をつけてくれよ
無事にここへ戻って来ると約束してほしい
君たちは歴史の証言者なんだからね","Please be careful and make sure to return here safely. I want you to promise me that. You are witnesses to history, after all."
"これからフィンダムへの渡航者が増えるだろうね
もちろん僕も準備を進めているんだ","The number of travelers to Phindym is likely to increase from now on, and of course, I am also preparing for it."
"覚者が一緒じゃないと戻ってこられないから
君たち、その時はよろしくたのむよ","I cannot return without the Arisen being present, so I ask you all to take care of me at that time."
"フィンダムで起こったことを記録して
後世に残そうと思っているんだけど――","I want to record what happened in Phindym and leave it for future generations to see--"
"また何か起こりそうな気配だね","It feels like something is about to happen again."
"アッカーシェランか
自然環境はこっちとほぼ同じなんだね
つまり、理と竜の世界ということか","Is this Acre Selund?
The natural environment here is almost the same, right?
In other words, it's a world of order and dragons."
"アッカーシェランの状況は良くないみたいだけど
それでも君たちはレスタニアの代表なんだ","The situation in Acre Selund doesn't seem to be good, but even so, you are representatives of Lestania."
"可能な限り、いい顔でたのむよ","Please do it with a smile, if possible"
"とにもかくにも今はネド王子だね","In any case, you are Prince Nedo now."
"解放軍はここに来てずいぶん敵を
刺激したからね
反撃は覚悟しないと","The Liberation Army has certainly stimulated the enemy since they have arrived here. We must be prepared for counterattacks."
"盗賊と言えば荒くれ者と相場が決まっている
本拠地に乗り込むんだから
言動には気をつけて","When it comes to thieves, they are often considered rough individuals.
Since we are infiltrating their headquarters,
be careful with your words and actions."
"ガルドリンには特に強く言っておかないと","I need to make sure to tell Gurdolin firmly."
"盗賊の次はオークの本拠地だって？
君たちはそっちの方が慣れているかな","Next is the orc's stronghold, huh? I wonder if you guys are more familiar with that."
"ネド王子と解放軍が合流したんだ
敵の警戒も厳しくなるだろうね","Prince Nedo and the liberation army have joined forces
Enemy vigilance will also intensify, I suppose."
"アッカーシェランで“悪しき竜”との
全面戦争が始まるのかな","Is a full-scale war against the ""Evil Dragon"" about to begin in Acre Selund?"
"アッカーシェランとも、フィンダムのような
友好的な関係になれるといいね","I hope we can establish a friendly relationship with Acre Selund, just like with Phindym."
"アッカーシェランに灯った希望の火を
消してはいけないよ","Do not extinguish the flame of hope that has been lit in Acre Selund!"
"君たち自身も希望なんだ
それを忘れないでくれ","You yourselves also have hope,
Please do not forget that."
"ひとつだけわかったのは――
“悪しき竜”はすぐに君たちを亡き者に
するつもりはないということ","The only thing I understood is that the ""Evil Dragon"" has no intention of taking you out immediately."
"これは悪くない事だと思うよ","I think this is not a bad thing."
"今のジョゼフ様は猜疑心の塊だよ
何を言い出しても驚かないことだね","Joseph is currently a bundle of suspicion. It's not surprising no matter what he says."
"今のジョゼフ様は猜疑心の塊だよ
何を言い出しても驚かないことだね","Joseph is currently a bundle of suspicion. It's not surprising no matter what he says."
"本格的な城攻めを前にしての休暇かな？","Is it a vacation before a serious castle attack?"
"レスタニアは平和なものさ
気分転換に散歩でもどうだい？","Lestania is a peaceful place.
How about taking a walk for a change of mood?"
"奪回した城を拠点に力を蓄えて
“悪しき竜”の討伐を目指すのだよね？","To gather strength at the recaptured castle
and aim to defeat the ""Evil Dragon,"" right?"
"道のりはまだまだありそうだから
じっくり行かないとね","The journey seems to still have a long way to go,
so we must proceed carefully."
"今朝、ぶつけて爪が欠けてしまってね
嫌な予感がするんだ","I bumped it this morning and chipped a nail.
I have a bad feeling about this."
"謎の騎士の話題で持ちきりだね
正体はどうあれ、強敵に違いないから
万事準備怠りなく、だよ？","The topic of the mysterious knight is all the buzz, right? Regardless of their identity, they are definitely a formidable opponent. So, let's prepare ourselves for anything, okay?"
"王都の戦いが終わらないと
落ち着かないよね","I can't calm down until the battle in the Royal Capital is over."
"今は解放軍と一緒に王都奪回の戦いに
専念するのがいいと思うよ","I think it's best to focus on the battle to recapture the Royal Capital with the Liberation Army."
"考え得る対策を書きだして
とにかく吟味する","Write down all possible measures and thoroughly scrutinize them."
"そして、良さそうなのがあれば
君たちにも伝えるからね","And if there is something good,
I will also let you guys know."
"あれこれ書物に当たっているけど
こんな危機はかつてなくて
白竜様と僕たちが初めてのようだ","I'm hitting various books and such, but this crisis is unprecedented. It feels like The White Dragon and we are experiencing something for the first time."
"頼むよ――
黒騎士の剣を取り戻して","Please, I beg you-
Retrieve the sword of The Black Knight."
"さあ、急いで","Come on, hurry up."
"君たちを助けるセシリーの竜力は
あくまでも仮初めの力
そう長くは続かないと思うよ","Cecily's Dragon Force, which helps you, is merely a temporary power. I don't think it will last long."
"レスタニアの命運は尽きる寸前だった――
あはは――今になって脚が震えるよ","Lestania's fate was on the brink of exhaustion ――
Ahaha―― My legs are trembling now."
"ネド王子はたしかにまだ子供だけど
聞く限り、無茶はしない印象だよ","Prince Nedo is certainly still a child, but from what I hear, he gives the impression of not doing anything reckless."
"姿を消したとなると、何か深い事情が
あるんだろうね
解決可能なことだといいけど――","If he disappeared, there must have been some deep reason behind it. I hope it's something that can be resolved."
"ジョゼフ様がまたなんか言ってるだろ？
人を疑うのが性分なんだね","Joseph is saying something again, right?
It's in his nature to suspect others."
"これは王子なりによく考えた末の
行動だと思うよ
そうじゃないと、君たちから聞いていた
王子の印象と合わないからね","I think this is an action that the prince has carefully considered. Otherwise, it wouldn't match the impression of the prince that I have heard from you."
"王子には何か目的があるのだろうけど――","I'm sure the prince has a purpose, but--"
"その目的を果たしたあとは
どんな顔をして仲間のところへ戻る気で
いるんだろうね
あまり考えていないのかな","After achieving that goal,
I wonder what expression they will have
when they return to their comrades.
I wonder if they haven't thought about it much."
"火垂れ山は“悪しき竜”の住み処だよね","Firefall Mountain is the dwelling place of the ""Evil Dragon,"" right?"
"いつ襲撃されてもおかしくないから
四方八方、気を抜かないようにね","Since we could be attacked at any time, let's stay on high alert in all directions"
"行ったり来たり、ご苦労だね","Going back and forth, you've had it tough."
"以前はうらやましいと思ったけど
最近は――ああ、僕も歳を取ったのかな","I used to think it was enviable
But lately ―― ah, I guess I've also gotten older"
"早くアッカーシェランへ向かった方がいいよ
状況は王子の動き次第で変わるんだから","It would be better to quickly head towards Acre Selund; the situation can change depending on the prince's movements."
"“悪しき竜”は力だけを与えられた子供――
そんなふうに考えられないかな？","Can't we consider the ""Evil Dragon"" as a child who has been bestowed with power alone?"
"力だけで知識も経験も与えられなかったから
釣り合いが取れなくて――
いやいや、問題はそこじゃないか！","They gave no knowledge, no experience, just power.
There was no balance...
No, no, no, that's not the point!"
"誰が与えたか――与えなかったのか――
考えるべきなのは背後にいたのは
誰かって話だよね","Who gave -- or didn't give --
What we should be thinking about is who was behind it"
