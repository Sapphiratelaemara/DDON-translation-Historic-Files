"ああ、その話だな
いいだろう","Ah, that story, right? That's fine."
"立場上、ひいきするわけにはいかないが
私が最も愛するジョブは当然《ファイター》だ","On principle, I cannot show favoritism, but my most beloved job is, of course, ""Fighter."""
"己が身を敵前にさらし、盾と剣を巧みに操り
それはまるで舞の如く――","Exposing oneself to the enemy and deftly wielding shield and sword. It's like a dance—."
"突破口を開いて敵陣深く入り込み
本陣をかく乱する――
ふふ、敵が驚き、呆ける顔を間近で見られるのは
《ファイター》だけだ！","Opening a breakthrough and infiltrating deep into enemy territory
Disrupting their main force -
Hehe, being able to see the surprised and bewildered faces up close
Is something only a Fighter can do!"
"おまえもなかなか腕を上げ、《ファイター》と
しての自覚を身に付けつつあるようだな","You have also been improving quite a bit and seem to be gaining a sense of being a Fighter."
"――よし、私から修練を課してやろう
そして今以上に技を磨き、一流の剣士となれ！","Alright, I will impose training upon you And thus, polish your skills even more, become a first-class swordsman!"
"よし、いいだろう
《ファイター》を名乗ることを許そう","Okay, fine. I'll allow you to call yourself a Fighter."
"まぁいい
新たな剣技を教えてやる","Well, never mind. I will teach you a new sword technique."
"今以上に強くなりたければ、修練を重ね
さらに技を会得するのだな","If you want to become stronger than you are now, train harder and further hone your skills."
"ほう――、かなり腕を上げたようだな
今のおまえなら、あの技も使い
こなせるだろう","Well, you've really improved your skills, haven't you?
With your current ability, you should be able to use that technique and master it."
"剣の役割とは相手を斬ること
だが、それは道具としての役目であって
剣の本質ではない","The role of a sword is to slash the opponent.
However, that is only its function as a tool.
It is not the essence of a sword."
"敵を削ぎ己を活かす
それこそが本質だ
勝敗、生死は全て、その結果
付いてくるものにすぎない","Reduce your enemy and make the most of yourself; 
That's the essence.

役割だが、ただ攻撃をすればよいというわけではない
自身を守り、先陣に居続けることが仲間を救い
ひいては勝利につながるのだ","The greatest role imposed on a Fighter is to defeat enemies, but it's not simply about attacking. Protecting oneself and staying at the forefront can save comrades and ultimately lead to victory."
"攻守どちらをおろそかにしても、一流のファイター
とは言えないというわけだ","Regardless of whether you neglect offense or defense, it means that you cannot be called a first-class Fighter."
"敵と斬り結ぶ中、技術は後からでも付いてくる
ファイターとなるなら、まずは剣と盾が身体の一部と
思えるようになるまで振るい、感覚をなじませろ","With cutting with the enemy, the skill comes later.
If you want to be a fighter, first swing your sword and shield until you feel like they are part of your body
and familiarize yourself with them."
"それ以上のことは、おまえが一人前のファイターに
なった頃に教えてやる","I will teach you more when you become a full-fledged Fighter."
"盾は、身を守るだけのものではないぞ
使いようによっては敵の攻撃をいなし
反撃の足掛かりとすることもできる","The shield is not just for self-defense. Depending on how it is used, it can block the enemy's attacks and serve as a foothold for counterattacks."
"攻撃を受ける直前、敵の体重がかかる
わずかな瞬間を見定めろ","Just before receiving an attack, determine the moment when the enemy's weight is applied."
"そこを捉えれば反動はそっくり相手に
返り、態勢を崩すことができるだろう","If you seize that moment, the recoil will be completely returned to the opponent
, and you will be able to disrupt their stance."

ちまたではそんな呼び方をしているらしい
覚えておくことだ","《Critical Timing》――
It seems that is what they call it.
Remember that."

私に稽古をつけてもらいたいのか？","Oh... Do you want me to teach you a lesson?"
"なら少なくとも《ファイター》となり
ジョブレベル１８以上の経験を
積むことだな","Then you should at least become a 《Fighter》
and have at least 18 job levels of experience"
"その後、訓練官レンテンの許可が
出たなら考えてやろう
話はそれからだ","After that, I'll think about it if the Training Officer Renton gives the green light.
Then we'll talk about it."
"あぁ――
私に稽古をつけてもらいたいのか？
なるほど確かに相応の腕になったようだ","Oh--
you want me to train you?
Well, you certainly look like you're up to snuff."
"だが何事にも順序がある
まずは神殿の訓練官レンテンに
ジョブの基本を修めた報告くらいはしてこい","But there's an order to everything.
First, you should at least report to Lenten, the temple trainer,
that you've mastered the basics of the job."
"正式に教えを請いにきたならば
稽古に付き合ってやろう","If you have come to formally seek knowledge,
I shall accompany you in your training."
"戦術を指南してほしいのか？
ならば実戦に勝る教えはないぞ","You want me to teach you tactics?
Then there's no better way to learn than through combat."
"戦いは勝つためにするのだ
そのための努力、怠るな","We fight in order to win. Do not neglect the effort required for that."
"すまないな
世間話というものが苦手なんだ","I'm sorry,
but I'm not good at small talk"
"集中だ！

"覚者とは何か――
いろいろな考えがあるだろうが
自分は、戦人（いくさびと）だと信じている","What is an Arisen? There may be various thoughts, but I believe I am a warrior."
"こう戦闘続きでは疲れもたまるな――
キノザでゆっくりしたいものだ","I'm getting tired after all these battles-- I'd like to relax in Kinoza."
"魔物より恐ろしい敵の名を教えてやろう
それは――油断、慢心、怠慢だ","I will teach you the name of an enemy more frightening than monsters. It is--carelessness, complacency, and negligence."
"どれほどの敵を倒せば
この地に平穏が訪れるのか――
こんなことを思うとは――老いたか","How many enemies must I defeat for peace to come to this land? To think such a thing... have I grown old?"
"勝利の秘策？
そんなものがあるなら、そもそも戦争など起こらない","The secret strategy for victory?
If such a thing exists, wars wouldn't happen in the first place."
"価値を問う前に、黙って守れ
失って後悔したくなければな","Before you question the value, shut up and protect
unless you want to lose it and regret it."
"何？　拠点防衛に関する提案？","What? A proposal regarding base defense?"
"オークどもをぶっ倒し、追いだしても
臭いはしばらく残るんだ
たまらん――くそっ！","Even if you knock the orcs off and drive them out
the smell lingers for a while.
I can't stand it -- damn it!"
"魔物掃除に来たのか？","Did you come to exterminate the enemy?"
"だったら遠慮はいらない
砦の外でひと暴れしてきてくれ","Then you don't need to hold back.
Please go wild outside the fortress."
"アルヴァーと会ったらしいな
だったら、こんなところにいないで
さっさと契約をすませたらどうだ？","I heard you met Alvar.
If that's the case, why don't you finish the contract quickly?
You shouldn't be here instead."
"どうした？
レオの話し相手は退屈か？","What's the matter?
Bored of talking to Leo?"
"だったら遠慮することはない
思う存分魔物と戦ってくれ","In that case, there's no need to hold back.
Fight monsters to your heart's content."
"おや――また来たのか","Oh, you've come back again."
"ひまだと言うなら、遠慮はいらない
このあたりの魔物を片っ端から倒してくれ
まったくどこからわいてくるのやら――だな","If you say you have free time, there's no need to hold back.
Please defeat all the enemies around here one by one.
I wonder where they're coming from."
"オークどもの行動様式が明らかに変化している
そちらも警戒を怠るなとレオとゲルト団長に
伝えてくれ","The behavior patterns of the Orcs have clearly changed. Please also inform Captain Leo and Gerd to stay alert."

"神殿の様子はどうだ？","How is the temple?"
"ひまそうな覚者がいたら
訓練がてら顔を出すように伝えてくれ","If there are any idle Arisen, please tell them to come and train with me as a practice session."

"オークはズールとかいう魔物と手を組んだ
このところ感じていた違和感の正体は
それだったようだ","The Orc has formed an alliance with a creature called Zuhl. The true identity of the discomfort I had been feeling lately seems to be that."

"ところがあのズールがオークを変えてしまった
小賢しい――薄汚い魔物め――
もう憎しみしかない","However, that Zuhl changed the orcs into a cunning, filthy enemy... There is only hatred left."

"イリスに会ったらたまには顔を出すように
伝えてくれ","If you meet Iris, please tell her to show her face once in a while."
"もしやおまえはわたしと同類ではないのか？","Are you not like me?"

着飾った街の住人よりも
薄汚れた鎧カブトの戦士を愛おしく思う――","I prefer the frontline fortress over the tidy temple――
I cherish the dirty armored soldier more than the well-dressed residents of the city――"

"不覚だ――面目ない――","I am not Arisen - I am ashamed -"
"しかし、案ずるな
わたしはもう未来を見ている
もうオークの好きにはさせないさ","But don't fret.

――Yeah, it's impossible."
"最前線だったこの砦も
今では時折小競り合いが起こる程度だ","This fort, which used to be the front line,
now sees only occasional skirmishes."
"殺気で肌がヒリヒリ傷むような戦場――
そんな場所を探して旅に出ようか
――最近、そんなことを思うんだ","A battlefield where the skin stings with a killing intent -
Should I search for such a place and embark on a journey?
Lately, I've been thinking about such things."

身を隠すように言ってやった方が
いいかもしれないぞ？","Do you know where Iris is?
It might be better to tell her to hide."

このあたりの魔物が騒がしくなってな
なかなか離れることができないのだ","Damn it――
The enemies around here are getting noisy.
