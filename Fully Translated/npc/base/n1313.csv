old,
"テル周辺の事で相談か？
用件を伺おう","You want to talk to me about the Tel area?
Let's hear what you have to say."
テルの西に振ってきた炎に包まれた何か――,Something engulfed in flames swung from the west of Tel--
"黒い石の塊のようなものなのだが
不気味でしかたがない
その近くで異様な姿のゴブリンを
見たという者もいる――","It's like a block of black stone, but
it's just creepy.
Some people have seen strange-looking goblins
near it-- some say they've seen them-- and they're not sure what they're supposed to be."
村に影響がなければいいのだが,"As long as it doesn't affect the village, it's fine."
"わたしの役割はテルと白竜神殿との仲介だ
ハイデル平原で起こった問題について
聞きたければ、いつでも訪れてくれ","My role is to mediate between Tell and the White Dragon Temple
about the problems that have occurred in the Heidel Plains
If you want to ask me about it, you can visit me anytime."
"魔物の増加に資材の不足
そして何より村の病――
悩みの種はつきないものだ","More demons, lack of materials
and above all, the village's illnesses--
are a constant source of worry."
"一つでも多くの問題解決に、協力頂けると助かる
貴君のことは頼りにさせてもらう","I would appreciate your help in solving as many problems as possible.
I will be relying on you."
"おお、よく来てくれた
ちょうど貴君に伝えたいことがあってな！","Oh, thank you for coming.
I just had something I wanted to tell you!"
"このハイデル平原に設置された
《辺境の礎》が全て解放されたのだ！
これでハイデルの隅々まで足を運びやすくなるだろう","All of the
""Frontier Cornerstones"" set up here in the Heidel Plains have been released!
Now it will be easier to visit every corner of Heidel!"
"貴君も最近は覚者隊での地位を築き、
益々の活躍に忙しいと聞いている
効率の良い探索のためにも、ぜひ活用してくれ","I hear that you have recently established your position in the Sentinel Corps and are busy
increasing your activities.
Please make use of it for efficient search!"
"以前、テルの西に降ってきた黒い塊――
そう、《アーク》といったか
あの付近を新手の魔物が徘徊しはじめてな","That black mass that fell to the west of Tel--
""Ark"", was it?
There are new monsters roaming that area now."
"今のところ移動する気配は無いが
万が一、村に近寄ることがあれば
混乱は避けられないだろう","There are no signs of movement so far, but
if they start to approach the village,
there is sure to be trouble."
"付近の魔物の動向は把握しておきたいのだ
もし調査を頼めるのなら、
あらためてわたしに話しかけてほしい","I'd like to know what's going on with the monsters in the area.
If you can help investigate,
please come speak with me again."
"貴君が以前調査してきてくれた《アーク》だが
裏側にもう一つ出入り口があったのを知っているか？","That ""Ark"" that you investigated earlier--
Did you know there is another entrance at the back?"
"何かの罠である可能性を警戒して封鎖していたのだが
今の貴君であれば心配は無さそうだ
封鎖を解いておこう","Be wary of the possibility that it may be a trap and sealed it off.
But with your current status, there seems to be no need to worry.
Let's remove the seal."
"興味があれば中を調べてみるのも良いかもしれぬ
ただ、中に魔物がいることは確実だろう
調査の際は十分に注意しておくことだ","If you're interested, it may be good to investigate inside.
However, it is certain that there are enemies inside.
Be cautious during the investigation."
"――口うるさいと思わないでくれ
このテルの守り手を失いたくはないのだ","Please don't think I'm being annoying.
I don't want to lose my Protector of Tel."
"ああ、よいところに来てくれた
実は貴君に相談したいことがあったのだ","Ah, you've come at a good time.
I actually have something I want to discuss with you."
"以前調査してきてもらった《アーク》の付近から
最近、虫や小動物の姿が消えているのだ","From the vicinity of the 《Ark》 that you have previously surveyed for me
, insects and small animals have been disappearing lately."
"アークに変化が起こっているのかも知れん
そこで、貴君に内部を
調査してきてもらいたいのだが、頼めるだろうか","There may be a change in the arc
so I need you to go inside
and check it out, can you do that for me?"
"引き受けてくれるようであれば、
あらためてわたしに話しかけてくれ
わたしもアークの周囲を調べてわかったことがある
貴君に詳しく伝えよう","If you are willing to accept,
please talk to me again
I've been looking around ARC and found out some things
I'll tell you more about it."
"貴君の働きにはわたしも、テルの村人たちも
とても感謝しているのだ","I and the villagers of Tell are very grateful to you for your work
"
"今回、村人たちからの強い希望もあって
支援品としてさらに良いものを揃えることにした","This time, due to strong requests from the villagers,
we have decided to have an even better selection of support items."
"貴君への恩に報いるには足りぬが、
村のみなからの気持ちとして受け取ってくれ","It is not enough to repay your debt to me, but please accept it as a gesture from all of us in the
village."
"これからも、よろしく頼む
テルとハイデルの守り手であってくれ","Please keep up the good work.
Be a defender of Tell and Heidel."
"貴君がレオの信頼を得ているならば、
あるいは好奇心に身を任せるならば――","If you have Leo's trust,
or if you let your curiosity get the better of you--"
"それだけ多く、様々な地を
訪ねることになるだろう
そして、貴君の活躍を待つ者も多いだろう","So many, many places
will be visited
and many will be waiting to see you in action!"
"白竜が衰えたことで
レスタニアはこの300年、様々な異変や
魔物に襲われるようになった
むろん、抱える問題もそれぞれだ","With the decline of the white dragon,
Lestania has been attacked by various mutations and
demons for the past 300 years.

エリアマスターへの挨拶を忘れるな
クセの強い者もいるが、皆この役を誇りに思っている","When you go to a new place
don't forget to say hello to the Area Master
Some are quirky, but all are proud of their roles!"
"つまり、貴君の味方だ
我々を大いに活用しつつ各地の問題を解決してくれ","So, you are on our side
Please make use of us greatly and solve the problems in various places"
"貴君にはすでに恩がある
そこでだ、ミスリウ方面――
ポーン郷やリンウッドの村へ向かう道を提供しよう","You already have our gratitude
Therefore, to the direction of Missleau
I will provide a way to the villages of Pawn Cathedral and Lynwood"
"テルのすぐ西にある洞窟、《狩人の抜け穴》
を通れるようにしておく
村人にとっては危険だが、貴君なら通れるだろう","To the west of Tel, there is a cave, the Hunters' Secret Passage
Make sure you can pass through
It is dangerous for the villagers, but you should be able to pass"
"だが、中には野盗の類や危険な獣も多い
十分注意してくれ","However, there are many bandits and dangerous animals inside
Be wary"
"《狩人の抜け穴》に出る魔物やアイテムの
情報は、《エリア情報》の《スポット情報》
で確認していくことを勧めよう","It is recommended to check the information on the monsters and items that appear in ""Hunters' Secret Passage"" in the ""Area Information"" and ""Spot Information."""
"色々手伝ってもらってすまないな
貴君への支援品を用意した
これからも手を貸してくれ","Sorry for all the help you've been giving me
I've got a support package for you
Keep up the good work!"
"ところで、白竜が衰えたことで
レスタニアはこの300年、様々な異変や
魔物に襲われるようになった","By the way, with the decline of the white dragon,
Lestania has been attacked by various mutations and
demons for the last 300 years!"
――それは、このハイデルも例外ではない,――Heidell is no exception to that.
"すでに知っているかもしれないが
テルはここしばらく謎の疫病に
苦しめられている","As you may already know
Tell has been suffering from a mysterious plague
for some time now"
"疫病の原因調査は、これまでに多くの
覚者が挑んだが、未だ解決には遠い","The investigation of the cause of the epidemic has been challenged by many
Arisen people, but it is still far from being solved"
"今の貴君の手にはあまるだろうが
いずれ時が来れば詳しく話そう","I know it's too much for you right now
but we'll talk more about it when the time comes."
"これからも、テルとハイデルを
よろしく頼む","Keep up the good work Tel and Heidel at
"
"――実はな、困ったことになったのだ
テルの東にある通称《鬼鳴き橋》に
厄介なゴブリンが戻ってきたようなのだ","Well, you see, something troublesome has happened. It seems that a troublesome goblin has returned to the bridge commonly known as the ""Roaring Demon Bridge"" to the east of Tel."
"ヤツは《橋守のビンシャ》と名乗り
東の橋を占拠し陣取っている小鬼どものリーダーだ
見かけたらそいつを退治してくれないだろうか","He is the leader of the small demons who call themselves
""Bridgekeeper Binshaw"" and have occupied and entrenched themselves in the eastern bridge.
Can you defeat and get rid of them if you see them?"
"ヤツは返り討ちにした騎士や覚者から
いくつも《グレードの高い装備》を奪っているらしい","It seems that he has taken several
""high-grade equipment"" from the knights and the Arisen he has defeated."
"討伐できたなら、貴君がそれを
奪い返し手に入れることもできるだろう
頭のかたすみに留めておいてくれ","If you can subdue him, you will also be able to retrieve it
and get it back.
Please keep that in mind."
"村を代表して礼を言う
貴君はテルにとって英雄だ","I will express my gratitude on behalf of the village.
You are a hero to Tel."
"これからもどうかよろしく頼む
わたしも貴君のために、できることを探してみよう","I have an idea,
please continue to rely on me, I will try to find what I can do for you"
こちらから貴君に朗報だ！,Here's good news for you!
"大水で損壊していた
《南ハイデル大橋》がようやく復旧したのだ
リンウッドから木材が届いてな","
The South Heidel Bridge, which had been damaged by the flood, was finally restored.
Lumber arrived from Lynnwood."
"これで、例の抜け穴を通らずとも
テルからミスリウ森林方面に
行きやすくなったぞ","Now it's easier to get to
from the
tell to the Misliu Forest without having to go through the loophole in the example!"
"おお、来てくれたか！
貴君に伝えねばならんことがあったのだ
――そう、例の《ハイデル地下霊廟　深部》
についてだ","Oh, you've come!
I have something to tell you about
-- yes, about the ""Heidel Underground Mausoleum Deep""
"
"霊廟の地下二階より下は
先代のエリアマスターが
早期の段階で封鎖していたよ","Below the second basement floor of the mausoleum
the previous area master
had it sealed off early on!"
"あの《開かずの路》で発見した手帳に
そのくだりと、霊廟深部の封鎖を解除する
スペリングが書かれていた","The notebook I found in that ""open road""
had that crap and the
spelling to break the blockade deep in the mausoleum."

please talk to me again."
"いつもすまないな
お陰で本当に助かっている
心ばかりだが、礼をさせてくれ","I'm always sorry
You've been a real help
Let me thank you from the bottom of my heart."
"――そろそろ貴君にもあの件を伝えておこう
例のハイデル教会の司祭だった男
メンヴィルについてだ","――I think it's about time I inform you about that matter.
About Menvili, the man who was a priest at the infamous Heidell Church."
"もう数十年前のことだが、司祭は
村人から邪教崇拝の疑いをかけられて
追われ、失踪した","Decades ago, the priest was
suspected by the villagers of pagan worship,
chased and disappeared."
"司祭の家の地下室から、多数の死体と
怪しい祭壇が発見されたからだ","Because a number of dead bodies and a
suspicious altar were found in the basement of a priest's house."
"――貴君も心当たりがあるだろう？
前に貴君が魔物退治をしたあの廃屋――
あそここそ、司祭メンヴィルの住居なのだ","Perhaps you have an idea as well?
That abandoned house where you exterminated the monsters earlier--
That place is none other than the residence of Priest Menvili."
"以来、地下室から続く祭壇への通路は
《開かずの路》と呼ばれ、封印すべき場所として
先代のエリアマスターから受け継いだ","Since then, the passage to the altar that leads from the basement is called
""The Open Road"" and is a place that should be sealed
inherited from the previous area master."
"わたしも中を調べるつもりだが
貴君も興味があれば行ってみてくれ","I'm going to check inside too
if you're interested."
"司祭、霊廟、そしてこの《開かずの路》――
疫病と何か関係がある気がしてならない","Priests, mausoleums, and this ""open road"" -
I can't help but think it has something to do with the plague."
"貴君には手伝ってもらってばかりだな
良ければまた手を貸してくれ","You've been helping me a lot.
I'd like to give you a hand again, if you don't mind."
"貴君、《血すすぎ河原》のことは知っているか？
あの場所に、ひときわ体の大きなリザードマンが
棲みつくようになったのだ","Have you ever heard of the ""Blood Soak Riverbed""?
A very large lizardman
has come to inhabit that place!"
"河原はテルとも近い
かの大トカゲが村人や家畜を襲う前に
退治してくれないだろうか","The riverbank is also close to Tel
before that giant lizard attacks villagers and livestock
"
"――貴君、そういえば例の《開かずの路》へは
行ってみたか？","By the way, have you tried going to that 'Blocked Passage' we mentioned before, my lord?"
"村の枯れ井戸と繋がっていたとは――
あれが、枯れていなかったらと思うと
ぞっとする話だ","I didn't realize it was connected to the village's dry well--
I'd be horrified if it hadn't
"
"たまに何やら臭うのも
おそらくそのせいだったのだな――","Sometimes it smells like something, too.
Perhaps that was the reason--"
"わたしもあの場所を調べ、手掛かりらしき
先代の手帳を見つけたのだ
もう少し調べがついたら、貴君に伝えよう","I also checked that place and found a clue
that looks like my predecessor's notebook
I'll pass it on to you when I've done some more research."
"ああ、そう言えば！
渡したいものがあるのだ","Oh, by the way!
I have something for you."
"貴君のためにこれを取っておいた
どうか、旅に役立ててくれ","I have kept this for you,
please make use of it on your journey"
"貴君、ハイデルで最も危険な場所は
どこか知っているか？","Do you know the most dangerous place in Heidel,
?"
"それは、東にある教会の地下墓地
《ハイデル地下霊廟》だ","It is the underground cemetery of the church in the east,
called ""Hidell Catacombs"""
"調査に向かった覚者もほとんど戻らず
さまよい出る亡者も増えたので、
ここしばらく封鎖していたんだが――","Few of the Arisen people who went to investigate have returned
and more of the departed have wandered off, so
we've been on lockdown for a while now--and we're still here."
"貴君ならあの場所を調べることが
できるかもしれん
《ハイデル地下霊廟》を開放しよう","You might be able to check out that place

and open up the ""Heidel Underground Mausoleum""!"
"どうするかは委ねるが
行くなら頼みたいことがある
その気があれば、あらためて話しかけてくれ","I'll leave it to you to decide what to do, but
If you go, there's something I'd like to ask of you.
Please speak with me again if so."
"おお、貴君か
良い物資が手に入ったのだ
これを持って行ってくれ","Oh, it's you.
I've managed to get some good supplies.
Please take this with you."
"テルとハイデルのため力を尽くしてくれた
貴君に、わたしもできることを探してみたのだ","I wanted to do something for you
in return for all you have done for Tel and Heidell."
"現状手に入る最も良い支援品を
手配しておいた
貴君の恩に報いるには、とうてい足りていないがな","I've arranged for the best support goods we can currently get.
Though, I fear it is still far from enough to repay your kindness."
"これからも、よろしく頼む
テルとハイデルの守り手であってくれ","Please keep up the good work.
Be a defender of Tell and Heidel."
"よく来たな
今回の支援品だ、受け取ってくれ","You've made it!
Here are the support goods. Please take them."
"貴君、ハイデルの街道に野盗が度々
出ることは知っているだろう？","You know, my dear, that the streets of Heidel are often
riddled with wild thieves, don't you?"

東のアジトに居を構える盗賊集団だ","Their name is the Black Wolf Bandit Group
, a bandit group that has its hideout in the east."
"神殿から指名手配され姿を消していた
その首領ラダンが、どうやらアジトに
戻ってきたらしい","The leader, Ladan, who was wanted by the Temple and disappeared
, has apparently returned
to his hideout!"
"連中は、高価なアクセサリーや宝飾品を
かなりの量奪っているという話だ","It is said that they have stolen a considerable amount of expensive accessories and jewelry
."
"今や覚者隊でも騎士団でもなく、貴君が頼りだ
ヤツらの動向に目を光らせておいてくれ","Now it's not the Sentinel Corps or the Knights, it's you.
Keep an eye out for them."
"やあ、貴君は――
ガルドリンの騒動では世話になったな","Hey, you--
took care of me during the Gardolyn debacle."
"ところで、あの一件の裏側を
貴君はどこまで知っていた？","By the way, how much did you know about the other side of that one
?"
"病に倒れた母親をかかえ
苦労している若い娘がいて――","There's a young girl struggling
with an ailing mother..."

魔物退治を巡る賭博を思いついたらしい
もちろん、彼女に金を渡すことが目的だ","Galdrin heard about it and came up with the idea of
gambling over demon slaying.

もしガルドリンに会う機会があったら
わたしが感服していたと伝えてくれ","The father and son took a hot spring bath in Kinoza and left

If you ever get a chance to meet Galdrin,
tell him I was impressed."
"エリアマスターとはこれでなかなか
難儀な仕事でな――","Being an area master is quite a
difficult job, and I'm not sure I've ever had to do it..."
"しかし、覚者の援助をすることで
神殿、そして白竜に貢献していると思うと
大変に誇らしい","However, I am very proud
to think that I am contributing to
the Temple and the White Dragon by assisting the Arisen people!"
せいぜい、活用してやってくれ,Please make use of it as much as possible

見事なものだったと聞いているぞ","I hear that your performance was
brilliant."
"各地のエリアマスターも喜んでいることだろう
もちろん、わたしもだ
