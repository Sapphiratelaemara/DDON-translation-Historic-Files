"old",""
"よぉ、お互い大変だよな","Well, we're both going through a tough time, aren't we?"
"お前、自分のポーンの性格どうしてる？
俺はやっぱり《シャイ》だな","Hey, how do you determine the personality of your Pawns?
As for me, I'm definitely ""Shy""."
"ほら、守ってあげたくなる方が
戦いに身が入るだろ？
でも《ピュア》もいいよなぁ","See, the more you want to protect them, the more you want to fight, right?
But ""pure"" is good too."
"まぁでも、時と自分の状況に合わせて
変えるのもアリだからな
いろいろ試すといいさ","Well, it's also okay to change it depending on the time and your own situation. It's good to try various things."
"しかしなかなか目当ての
《クレスト》が手に入れられなくてなぁ
オーブを手に入れるのに一苦労だ","But I can't seem to get the ""Crest"" I'm looking for.
I'm having a hard time getting the orb."
"はぁ～、俺の注意が足りないのかなぁ
どうしてこう、毎度毎度！
自分のポーンを失う羽目に――","Haaa... I wonder if it's because I'm not paying enough attention. 
Why does this keep happening, every time! 
I end up losing my own pawns..."
"ま、連れ戻せてるだけマシかな","Well, I suppose it's better than not being able to bring them back."
"はは～ん、さてはアンタもそうだな？
いやいや良いって、お互い覚者だ
解ってるって！","Haha~n, It seems you're the same, aren't you?
Well, it's okay. We're both Arisen
You understand, right!"
