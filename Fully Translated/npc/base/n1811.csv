それは良かったんだけど、道中に
気味の悪い魔物がはびこっているの","Hey. 
The debris in the ""Odd Rock Valley"" that leads to the forbidden zone of Zandora has been removed, making it passable.

もしかしたら変わった魔物や財宝が
眠ってる――かもしれないわね","Because so many people get lost when they go exploring, we've had it blocked off.

"突然どうして現れたのかしら
誰かが遺跡にあった起動装置を
動かしでもしたのかしら","I wonder why it suddenly appeared.

死者の丘、ゾマの裏手に広がる
高台に《呪詛の庭》と呼ばれる場所があるの","Hey—
At the back of Zoma, on a hill called the Hill of the Dead, There is a place called the ""Garden of Curses."""

I like seeing the people gathered here."
"野望とか夢とか、ロマンとか力試しとか
そんな漠然としたモノに酔ってる人達って
可愛いと思わない？","Don't you think people who are intoxicated by such vague things like ambition, dreams, romance, and tests of strength are adorable?"

伝えてあげたいの
ここには、そういう話が集まるから","I want to convey a fragment of a chance to as many people as possible.
Because stories like that gather here."

この辺りにあるソレが全て使えるようになったそうよ
ついさっき、神殿からの使いがそう言っていたわ","There's a ""Sub Portcrystal"".
 It seems like everything around here can be used now. 
Just a moment ago, a messenger from the temple said so."
"不便だったところへも一瞬で移動できる
優れものだと聞いたけど――
何だか無粋だわ","I've heard it's great to get to places that were inconvenient in an instant, but--
it's kind of tacky."
"私はね、ザンドラ東部に来たのなら自分の足で
移動してほしいと思ってるのよ
この荒れ地に転がる数々のロマンの欠片を
見落としてほしくないもの――","You know, if you've come to Eastern Zandora, I'd like you to move on your own. 
I don't want you to miss the scattered fragments of romance that lie in this wild land—"
"ねぇ――最近、ここから東の方で
大きな鎧が暴れているらしいのよ――","Hey... Lately, it seems like there's a big armor causing trouble somewhere east from here..."
"きっと何らかの魔力で操られた鎧が
あの場所に染みついた死臭に導かれて
やって来たのね","The armor, likely manipulated by some kind of magic, has come to that place guided by the stench of death that permeates it."
"ふふ、この辺りでは珍しいことじゃないわ――
特にあそこは人獣問わず死体が多くて
《屍のすすり泣く地》なんて呼ばれているんですもの","Hehe, it's not unusual around here, you know-- especially that place, where there are many corpses, regardless of whether they are human or animals. 
It's called the ""Weeping Corpse Ground,"" after all."
"だけど、鎧のうろつく範囲が
段々拡がってきているらしいのが気がかりなの
このゾマにまでやってきたら――","But I'm concerned that the range of armor wandering around seems to be getting wider and wider.
If it gets to this Zoma..."
"探求者たちを支える町が潰えては、大変
頼もしい誰かが討伐に行ってくれないかしら――
ねぇ？","If the town that supports the adventurers collapses, it will be a disaster.
I wonder if someone reliable could go and subdue it, I wonder...
Hey?"

どんな場所かって？
カタコンベ――そう、地下墓地よ","So then, do you already know about the Mysterious Mausoleum?
What kind of place is it?
Catacombs――yes, an underground graveyard."
"元は歴史ある霊堂だったそうよ
けど、今は眠りにつくことができない死者たちが
彷徨い続けているんだとか――","Originally, it was a historic mausoleum, they say.
But now, it seems that the deceased who cannot find rest continue to wander."
"死者たちは本当に眠りにつくことが
できなかったのかしら？
それとも故郷であるザンドラがこんなことになって
無念さのあまり眠りから覚めてしまったのかしら――","I wonder if the deceased were truly unable to rest in peace, or if their homeland, Zandora, becoming like this caused them to awaken from their slumber out of overwhelming regret."
"そういえば
あの人たちまだ帰ってこないのよね――","Speaking of which, that guy hasn't come back yet--"
"ふふ、この前《幽玄の霊堂》に
意気揚々と盗掘に行った若者のことよ","Hmmm, I'm talking about the young man who went to the other day to steal from the Mysterious Mausoleum."
"まだ若い子たちだったんだけど
若さ故の無謀さで
死者の仲間入りをしちゃったのかしら","They were still young, but in their youthful recklessness, I wonder if they joined the dead."
"あら、貴方――
気になるって顔してるわね
よっぽど人が良いのかしら？","Oh, you... 
You have such an interested look on your face. 
I wonder if you're a really kind person?"
"いいわ、もし様子を見に行きたいなら
私に相談して","If you wish to go and see for yourself, please consult with me."
"今や貴方はこのゾマで
一番の探索者、そして戦士よ
貴方のような存在そのものがロマンと言っても
いいんじゃないかしら","Now, you are the greatest explorer and warrior in this Zoma. 
It might even be right to call an existence like you 'romance'."
"貴方と知り合えて、嬉しく思うわ
支援品をうんと格上のものにするから
また話を聞かせてちょうだい","I am glad to have met you.
I will upgrade the support goods even more, So please let me hear your story again."
"――ん、私ったら貴方に惹かれてるのかしら
ふふ――","Hmm, I wonder if I'm attracted to you. Hehe..."
