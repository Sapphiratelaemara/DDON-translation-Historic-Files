待たせてしまうかもしれん","It may take a little time to unleash the power of the treasure.
It would be better for the party to disband once and come back.

"――気付いているだろうが
このジョブはすでにLV.80に達しているな
レベルアップの効果が無駄になってしまうが
それでも宝珠を使うのか？","I guess you've noticed,
but this job has already reached level 80.
The effects of leveling up would be wasted,
but are you still going to use the treasure?"
"はい","Yes"
"いいえ","No"
"ふむ――このジョブで《「LV.80」成長の宝珠》を
使っても、上げられるスキルが無いようだ
スキルに関する効果が無駄になってしまうが
宝珠を使ってもよいのか？","Hmm―― It seems that there are no skills that can be raised even if you use the 《「LV.80」Orb of Growth》 on this job.
Although the effects related to skills will be wasted, is it okay to use the orb?"
"はい","Yes"
"いいえ","No"
"これは――このまま《「LV.80」成長の宝珠》を
使っても、効果のあるアビリティは無いようだぞ
今のジョブで宝珠を使うのか？","This... even if you use the 《「LV.80」Orb of Growth》 at this level, it seems there are no abilities to be raised.
Are you going to use the orb with your current job?"
"はい","Yes"
"いいえ","No"

不要なものだったようだ
まさに覚者の鑑よ","It seems that this orb was unnecessary for you, who has polished your skills on your own. Truly, you are an Arisen."

篭められた力を解放することで
より冒険がしやすくなるというものだ","The Orb that you brought with you is said to make it easier to embark on adventures by unleashing its hidden power."
"たとえば、各エリアランクが上昇したり
リム転移先とできる礎が解放されるといった
働きだな","For example, it works by increasing the rank of each area or
releasing Portcrystals that can be used as a Rift Teleport destination."
"――さて、この宝珠の力を解放するか？","Now then, should we unleash the power of this orb?"
"はい","Yes"
"いいえ","No"
"そういえば、おまえはすでに
かなりの礎に触れ、エリアに貢献して
きたのではないか？","Come to think of it, you've already touched
quite a few Portcrystals and contributed
to the area, haven't you?"

を持ってきたのか
これはまた貴重な物を手に入れたものだ","Wow,

上限まで引き上げることができる","With this, you can raise your current job
and your skills and abilities to the
maximum, except for special ones."
"《<VAL>》
この宝珠の力を解放するか？","《<VAL>》
Will you release the power of this treasure?"

パーティーは一度解散してきた方がよかろう
パーティーメンバーを無暗に
待たせてしまうかもしれん","It may take a little time to unleash the power of the treasure.
It would be better for the party to disband once and come back.

《<VAL>》
を使っても
レベルアップの効果が無駄になってしまうが
それでも宝珠を使うのか？","Hmm... In this job, even if you use《<VAL>》, the effects of leveling up will be wasted. Are you still going to use the treasure orb?"

を使っても、開放するアビリティは無いようだぞ
それでも、今のジョブで宝珠を使うのか？","This... even if you use the《<VAL>》as is, it seems there are no usable abilities. Are you going to use the orb with your current job?"
"はい","Yes"
"いいえ","No"
"そうか
おまえが納得しているのなら
わたしからこれ以上言うことはない","I see. If you're satisfied, I have nothing more to say."
"――よろしい
無事、レベルがあがったようだぞ","-- Good.
Looks like you're safe and leveled up."
"――よろしい
無事、スキルが解放されたようだぞ","――Alright.
It appears that the skill has been unlocked successfully."
"――これで
アビリティは無事、解放されたようだぞ","――It seems that the abilities have been successfully unlocked."
"さあ、行け覚者よ
白竜様の加護があらんことを――","Now, go forth, Arisen
May you be blessed by the White Dragon's grace."

転移の礎に何の影響もないが
それでも、この宝珠の力を解放してもよいか？","Even if the power of this Orb is released,
it will have no effect on the Portcrystals.
