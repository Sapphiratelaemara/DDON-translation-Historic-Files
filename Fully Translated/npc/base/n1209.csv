たまらんよ","I can't

船小屋まで行きにくくなってしまった
まったく迷惑なやつらだよ","More harpies around the beach
and it's harder to get to the boathouse

"ヒュージブルが居なかった時は、もっと沖まで
船が出せたというし、深い海でも泳げたそうだ","They say that when Huge Bull wasn't around, they could
sail farther out to sea and swim in deeper water!"

もうおらんな","But who knows about those old days
any more?"
"漁はほそぼそと続けとるよ
