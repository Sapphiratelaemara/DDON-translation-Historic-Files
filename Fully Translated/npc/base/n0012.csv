そんな気分じゃないんだよな――","Chatting is not on my mind right now—"
"なああんた、ひまなら俺と――

"自由に生きるってのは
思ったほど楽じゃないんだな、これが","Living free is not as easy as I thought it would be."

"その臭い――戦う覚者という感じで
悪くはないが、日常も大切にな","Wow, you stink. You certainly smell the part, Arisen, but it couldn't hurt to take a bath every now and then."

レオに任せるのが一番だな","It'd be best to leave it to Leo, who has a long history with her."

たとえエルフが死のうが――

戦いで忙しいかもしれないが
逸品珍品を見逃すなよ？","How's it going in Mergoda? You may be busy fighting the battle, but don't miss the gems and curiosities, okay?"
