old,
覚者だな？　任務で来たのか,Are you an Arisen? Did you come on a mission?
"村の東側、《鬼鳴き橋》のことは知ってるか？
あそこは忌々しい事に
今やゴブリン共の占領下だ","Do you know about the Oniminaki Bridge, east of the village?
That place is abominably
occupied by goblins now."
"騎士が変な飾りを撤去しても
覚者がゴブリンを退治しても
気が付いたらすぐまた元通りだよ
嫌になるよまったく","Even if a knight removes strange decorations
even if a Arisen being exterminates goblins
the next thing you know, it's right back to normal again
I hate it, I totally do."
"占拠したくせに橋守だと！
図々しいにもほどがある、小鬼どもめ","They occupy it and act as bridge guards!
These little demons are shameless."
"次から次へと、問題は山積みだ
どれか一つでもクエストボードの依頼を
受けて貰えれば助かるんだが","There are so many problems, one after another.
If only someone could take one quest from the quest board.
That would be a great help."
"テル村での任務か何かなら
組合宿に顔を出しておけよ","If it's a mission or something at Tel Village,
make sure to visit the guild lodge."
"今この村じゃ、妙な風邪が流行っててな
神殿に病を持ち込むなよ","There's a strange cold going around in this village right now.
Don't bring illness into the temple."
"オーク侵攻のおり、村の西に落ちてきた
アレ――","During the orc invasion, it fell to the west of the village
Ale--"
あのでかい岩の塊は、結局何なんだろうな？,I wonder what that big hunk of rock is after all?
