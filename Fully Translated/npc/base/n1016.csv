old,
"なんだ？
神殿からの任務なら表の《クエストボード》
で発布されているだろう","What is it?
If it's a mission from the temple, it would surely be announced on the ""Quest Board"" outside."
"手助けはできないな
ハインツ副団長の許可がないからな","I can't help you.
I don't have Vice Captain Heinz's permission."
"ここは白衛騎士団司令部だ
覚者が何か用か？",This is the White Knight Commandery. What business does the Arisen have here?
"２つ以上のミッションには
エントリーできないぞ",You can't enter more than one mission!
"先にエントリーしている方のミッションを
終わらせるか、エントリーを取り消して
再度こちらに戻るんだ","Either finish the mission you've already entered, or cancel your entry, then come back again."
覚者が俺に何か用か？,"Arisen, do you need anything from me?"
"為すべき時に為すべき事を
俺のモットーだ","My motto is to do what needs to be done when it needs to be done
"
つまり――無駄話は好まない,"In other words, I don't like idle chatter"
"あんたに含むところは何もないが
覚者と話すといい具合にイライラしてな
俺の性分だと思って、気にしないでくれ","I have nothing to include you in this, but
I get a good deal of frustration when I talk to Arisen people.
Guess it's just my nature, don't worry about it."
