old,
エリオットは一見頼りないけど、腕は立つ,"Elliot is seemingly unreliable, but he is skilled."
レスタニア者は一筋縄ではいかないね,Lestania citizens are not easy to deal with.
リズはああ見えて、かなりしっかりした子だね,"Lise, believe it or not, is a pretty reliable girl."
人は見かけによらない――そんな言葉を思い出したよ,Appearances are deceiving--I remember that saying.
ガルドリンは――見たとおりの人物のようだ,Gurdolin--seems to be exactly what he looks like.
"言葉の荒さも人の良さを隠すためのもの
まるでアッカーシェランの男のようにわかりやすい","The harshness of words is also a means to conceal one's goodness, just like a man from Acre Selund, it is easy to understand."
"隊長――あなたは不思議な人だな
あなたならなんとかしてくれる
――そう思わせてくれるよ",Captain ―― you are an intriguing person I believe you can do something ―― You make me think that way.
"そういう人のことを、このアッカーシェランでは
“竜に愛されてる”と言うのさ","We in Acre Selund call such a person ""loved by the dragon."""
"レスタニアも同じだろうけど
このアッカーシェランにも長い歴史があってね――",Lestania is probably the same but Acre Selund also has a long history—
"たいていは家と家、人と魔物の対立の歴史なんだ
竜との対立なんて初めてのことさ","Usually, it is a history of conflict between houses and houses, and people and monsters. It's the first time there's been a conflict with dragons."
"わたし、悪しき竜が現れるまでは野や山を見ても
何も思わなかったんだ","Until the evil dragon appeared, I didn't think anything of the fields and mountains."
"だけどね
自由に歩き回れるわけじゃなくなってからは
愛おしくてたまらない――勝手だよね","But you know, ever since I can no longer freely wander around,
I cherish it so much――it's selfish, isn't it?"
レスタニアには覚者が大勢いるんだろう？,Are there a lot of Arisen in Lestania?
"みんな強いのか？　一流の戦士なのか？
白翼覚者隊という生え抜きの部隊もあるんだよね","Are they all strong?　Are they first-class warriors?
There's also a freshly minted unit called the White Wing Arisen Corps."
――戦いが、いっぱいあるんだな,-- I'm sure there's a lot of fighting going on.
白竜は長く病んでいると聞いている,I have heard that The White Dragon has been ill for a long time.
"早く良くなるといいな
竜はいつでも心身ともに健やかでいてくれないと
世が闇に覆われてしまうようだ","I hope you get better soon.
The world seems to be covered in darkness if the dragon is not always healthy both mentally, and physically."
えーと、なに？,"Um, what?"
"こっちにいる間はわたしと一緒に
行動してもらうからね",You'll be working with me while you're here.
"将軍がいれば全体の士気もあがる
そういう人だよ、メイロワ将軍は",Having a general boosts overall morale. That's the kind of person General Meirova is.
"ネド王子とは、将軍に連れられて
挨拶に行って――それだけ",Prince Nedo and I were taken by the General to greet him--that's it.
"それでも、王子のためなら
戦えるし、王子を思えば希望を抱ける","Still, if it's for the prince, I can fight, and if I think of the prince, I can hold onto hope."
"――みんな同じさ
王家は、そういう一族なんだ",-- all the same. The Royals are that kind of family.
"今はネド王子が最優先
それ以外は考えたくないの","Right now, Prince Nedo is the top priority. I don't want to think about anything else."
"王子は状況に屈することなく
積極的に動いているみたいだね",The prince seems to be actively moving forward without succumbing to the circumstances.
"頼もしいと言えば頼もしいけど
本音を言うと――いや、やめておくよ","I'd say you're reliable, but...
To tell you the truth--no, I shouldn't."
"ネド王子と一緒の時間を作ってよ
良き助言者になってほしい","Make time to be with Prince Nedo.
Be a good advisor."
"オークどもの動きが活発だ
ふん、“悪しき竜”の言いなりのくせに","The Orcs are quite active, huh? Hmph, even though they're under the control of the ""Evil Dragon""."
"アッカーシェラン全土のオークが
動き始めたら、こっちも戦力を
分散する必要があるから――マズいね","If all the orcs in Acre Selund start moving, we'll need to disperse our forces as well - that's not good."
"“悪しき竜”が現れたってね
今度来たら、逃がさないよ","I heard an ""evil dragon"" showed up.
If he comes again, I won't let him get away."
"イェルハルドの近くで戦うのは
とても勉強になるよ",Fighting near Gerhard is very educational.
"イェルハルドの近くで戦うのは
とても勉強になるよ",Fighting near Gerhard is very educational.
"戦いが終わったらさ――
城で会おうね","When the battle is over--
I'll see you at the castle."
"はあ――いいね、やっぱり
この城は、落ち着くよ","Ha--good, I knew it.
This castle is so relaxing!"
ここに来て解放軍を増強できそうなんだ,It seems like we can strengthen the Liberation Army by coming here.
"人数が増えると作戦の選択肢も増えるし
あなたたちの負担も減るからね","The more people we have, the more operational options we have, and
the less work you guys have to do."
"わたしたちはとにかく城内を駆け回って
混乱を誘いつつ敵の部隊を削る――いい？","We will run around inside the castle, causing confusion and chipping away at the enemy's forces—sound good?"
ここにいてもいいの？,Is it okay if I stay here?
借りを返すときが来たようだね,It seems that the time has come to repay the debt.
そっちも、こっちも、とりあえず一段落だね,"Both there and here, we have made some progress for now."
"王子はアッカーシェランのただひとりの
覚者なんだ",The Prince is the only Arisen of Acre Selund
"王子の気持ち、わたしたちの気持ちが
どうあっても、選択肢はないよね","The prince's feelings, our feelings, no matter what, there is no option."
"焦っても仕方がないよね
――そう自分に言い聞かせてるよ","There's no point in rushing
-- that's what I keep telling myself."
"ふと気づくと、あなたたちに頼っている
自分に気づいて、あれ？って思うんだよね","When you suddenly realize, you depend on yourself and think, huh? When I suddenly realize it, I find myself relying on you guys. I become aware of myself and think, ""Huh?"""
王子も――そんな風に考えたのかな,Did the prince also think that way?
"悪しき竜との決戦がすぐそこにあるのに
気になることが多すぎるの","The battle against the Evil Dragon is right around the corner, but there are too many things that I'm worried about."
"死ぬかもしれないんだから、スッキリして
おきたいけど――贅沢なのかな","Since I might die, I want to feel refreshed, but is that being extravagant?"
いよいよ決戦――,"Finally, the decisive battle—."
"静かに、ギュッと――
覚悟を固めているのさ","Quietly, firmly—I'm steeling my resolve."
"こっちの状況が落ち着いたら
かならず訪ねていくから――","Once this situation here settles down, I will definitely come to visit."
案内してくれる？,Can you show me around?
