"old",""
"やあ、白き竜の覚者さん
アッカーシェランはどうだい","Hello, Arisen of the White Dragon. How is Acre Selund?"
"さて、この土砂をどうにかしなきゃいけないな
近くに散らばった力を集めてきてくれないか？","Now, we need to figure out what to do with this earth and sand. Could you gather the scattered power nearby for me, please?"
"俺たちの精神力――いや、魂というのかな
そういったものは、辺りを流れる竜力と
混じって曖昧なものになってるんだ","Our spiritual power - or soul, I guess you'd call it - is mixed up with the Dragon Force that flows around us, and it's all a blur."
"だから、一度俺自身が使える力として
集めてきてもらわないと動けなくてね","So, I can't move without first gathering power as something I can use myself."
"よしよし、これで何とかなるはずだ","Good, good. This should work somehow."
"なに、君をこの先へ導くことが
王家のためになるというならば
土砂をどける程度のこと――","Well, if it's in the best interest of the royal family to lead you beyond the dirt and sand--"
"ここにあった土砂か？
――恐らく、衝撃で吹き飛んでいったようだ
この先で土埃になって舞い散ってるんじゃないか？","Is this the sand and soil that was here? It seems like it was blown away by the impact. Could it be turning into dust and scattering ahead?"
"ああ、俺のことは気にしなくていい
用が無くなれば、また眠りにつくことになる
早いとこ寝かせてくれよ、ハハハ
――この国を頼んだぜ","Oh, don't worry about me. When I have no more use for you, I'll go back to sleep. Let me sleep early, hahaha—I'm asking for this country, man!"
"すまない、今は都合が悪いんだ
少し時間をおいてから
また来てくれないか","I'm sorry, it's inconvenient for me right now.
Could you come back later, after some time?"
"悪いね――","Sorry---"
"おっと、君の仲間は
すでにこの先に行ったことがあるようだな","Oops, it seems like your companions
have already gone ahead."
"仲間の力をたどって
一時的にここを通ることもできるが――
どうしたい？","You can temporarily pass through here by following the power of your comrades, but what do you want to do?"
"通常開拓する","Explore normally."
"仲間の力をたどる","Follow the power of your companion"
"確かに生きてる頃は王の一番傍にいたし
それなりに国に尽くしたつもりだけど――
俺はいわゆる“王の乳兄弟”ってやつでさ","I was the closest thing to the king when he was alive,
and I've served the country in my own way, but--
I'm what you might call the ""king's baby brother."""
"歴史に名を残すような、ものすごいことを
成し遂げたわけじゃないと思うんだよな
まさか、こんなに丁寧に葬られることになるとはね","I don't think I've accomplished anything incredible that will be remembered in history. I never expected that I would be buried so carefully like this."
"ところで、君は死んだ人間と話すことに
慣れてるみたいに見えるな","By the way, you seem accustomed to talking to the deceased."
"君を巻き込んですまないと思ってるんだ、俺は","I'm sorry for involving you, I am"
