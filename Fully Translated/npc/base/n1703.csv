"おお、俺に用か？","Oh, you wanted to see me?"
"こんな辺境によく来たな
魔物に食われないよう注意しろよ","I'm surprised you came to this remote area.
Be careful the demons don't eat you."
"オーク共が根城を近くに構えてから
村人の半分は、ずっと昔に別の地方へ移った","Since the orcs set up their stronghold nearby, half of the villagers have moved to another region a long time ago."
"今残ってるのは諦め悪い連中の家系だが
そうこうしてるうち、砦と関所で隔てられて
ここに残らざるを得なくなったってとこだ","The only ones left are the stubborn descendants who refuse to give up. 
As time went on, we became separated by forts and checkpoints. 
And this is where we ended up, unable to leave."
"俺もまぁ、そのクチだな","I guess I'm that kind of person too."
"オークに攫われた人間がどうなるか
考えたくもない――","I don't even want to think about what happens to people kidnapped by orcs--"
"それを諦めきれないのが、俺がここにいる
理由だな――","I can't give that up, which is why I'm here--"
"――このドラワンに残ってる者は
何かに囚われて動くことができない
者なのだろう","Those who remain in Drawan are probably unable to move, as if they are trapped by something."
"俺と同じような理由で囚われていた奴――
オークに攫われた恋人を追って奴らのアジト
《ガルドノック砦》へ潜入を試みた奴がいてな","There was someone who, for the same reason as me, was being held captive—
They attempted to infiltrate the hideout of the orcs, Gardnox Fortress, to rescue their kidnapped lover."
"かなりのやり手だった
オークの部隊長を一人で倒し
砦の見取り図を手に入れたそうだ
俺から見てもすごい執念だったよ","He was quite a capable person. 
He single-handedly defeated the Orc captain and obtained a map of the fortress. 
It was an incredible determination even from my perspective."
"あいつはどうなったのかな――
無事に恋人を助け出せたのなら
今頃は別の町にでも移っているのだろうが","I wonder what happened to that person--
If they were able to safely rescue their lover, They might have already moved to another town by now."
