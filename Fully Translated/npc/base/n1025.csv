"魔物討伐の報酬はすでに支給されたはずだ
私の記憶はたしかだ","I believe the reward for defeating the demons has already been paid.
I remember it well."
"覚者よ、魔物討伐の報酬が支給されたそうだ
保管ボックスより受け取ってくれ","Sentient, the reward for defeating the demons has been paid to you.
Please accept it from the storage box."
"もうひとつ言付かっている、覚者よ
かの魔物撃退への貢献が認められ
“すごいアビリティ”がもらえるそうだ
これがどうやらそうらしい――受け取れ","There is one more thing I must tell you, Arisen.
In recognition of your contribution to the defeat of that enemy, you will receive an ""amazing ability"".
It seems that is what this is - take it!"
"私はファビオ様のもの
他の者の命令は受け付けない","My master is Fabio.
I do not accept orders from anyone else."
"知らない覚者についていくなと
厳しく言いつけられている","I have strict orders not to follow another Arisen."
"商店区の店ではなく、ファビオ様との
アイテム取り引きを強く勧める","I strongly recommend doing business with Fabio rather than visiting the stores in the shopping district."
"――呼び込み？　と言われていたか
とにかく、ここで覚者たちにそう伝えるよう
私は言いつかっている","Did you say they were calling for me?
Anyway, I have been told to convey this message to the Arisen here."
"私の魅力ならできる、との事だ
よろしく頼む","I can do it with my charm, that's what they said
I'm counting on you"
"主は私によく問われる
ポーンとは、人か、それとも物か？
私には答えられぬ問いだ","The Master often asks me
What are Pawns, are they people or things?
It's a question I cannot answer"
"――ああ、だが覚者よ
すでに別のミッションを引き受けたようだな
ならそちらを済ますか、辞退するのが筋だろう
その後、あらためて参加を頼みたい","――Ah, but Arisen.
It seems you have already taken on another mission.
In that case, it would be appropriate to decline and finish that one instead.
Afterwards, I would like to request your participation once again."
"――その件なのだが、かの魔物は
現在どうやら姿を消しているらしい
目撃情報が入り次第、討伐隊の再募集を
予定している","-For that matter however, it seems that the enemy has currently disappeared.
As soon as there are any eyewitness reports, we plan to recruit an expeditionary force."
"どうやら、かの魔物を退散せしめたようだ
――覚者よ。あなた宛の報酬は預かっていないが
機会がくれば、ぜひ助力を","It seems that the enemy has been driven away
――Arisen. Although I have not received your reward
If the opportunity arises, please provide assistance"
"覚者よ、私に何か？","Arisen, do you need anything from me?"
