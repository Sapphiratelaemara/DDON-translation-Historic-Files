まだまだやることはたくさん残ってるね","Well―― There are still plenty of things left to do, right?"
"ここに来ると、なんというか――
ティネス砦を取り返したって実感が湧くよね","When you come here, it's like... you feel a sense of accomplishment, right? Like, we've taken back Fort Thines."
"変な話だけど、ここってなぜだか
ゴブリンがウロウロしてるんだ","It's a strange story, but for some reason, there are goblins wandering around here."
"当のゴブリンが妙に楽しそうにしてるから
みんな何となく見て見ぬふりしてるよ
どうもキャリーに懐いてるみたいだし――","Since the Goblin seems oddly happy, everyone is pretending not to see and just watching. It seems like he's attached to Carrie, so..."

キャリーを手伝うことにしたよ","I've decided to stay here with Brad and help Carrie."
"これでもハンターとして
罠仕掛けたり弓扱ったり
手先は器用な方だしね","I'm still a hunter; setting traps, handling bows, and I'm good with my hands."
"キャリー見てるとさ
なんか不思議とこっちも“やらなきゃ”
って思えるんだよね","When I watch Carrie, it's strange, but I also feel like I should do something."

ちょっと人にきつく当たることもあるけど
根はいいやつだよ","Brad and I have been together for a long time. Sometimes he can be a bit harsh with people, but deep down he's a good guy."
"以前ここへ荷物を運ぶ途中
ゴブリンたちに襲われたときも
なんとか私を逃がそうとしてくれたし","Before, when I was on my way here to deliver the package, even when I was attacked by goblins they somehow managed to help me escape."

助け合って生きていく喜びを感じられるのは
唯一いいことだと思えるよ","Despite the way the world is, I believe that the only good thing is being able to feel the joy of helping each other and living together."
