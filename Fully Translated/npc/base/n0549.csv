"old",""
"おう、調査の進捗はどうだ？","Oh, how's the investigation going?"
"辺りをぐるっと歩いてみたが
この島の生態系はレスタニアとは
えらく違うようだな","I walked around the area
and the ecosystem of this island seems to be very different from Lestania"
"いつ、どんな魔物が飛び出してくるかわからんぞ
とっさの状況にも対処できるよう
装備や持ち物は常に見直しておけよ
調査探索の基本だ！","You never know when and what kind of creatures will come at you. Always review your equipment and items so you can handle any situation that arises. It's the fundamentals of exploration and investigation!"
"この魔赤島調査隊は精鋭揃いだ
難しい任務ではあるが、士気も高い
――俺か？　俺も久しぶりに勇み立ってるな！","This Bloodbane Isle expedition team is comprised of elite members. Although it is a difficult mission, their morale is high. ――As for me? I'm also feeling a surge of courage after a long time!"
"前はグリッテン砦の防衛戦に参加していたんだが
モゴックの奴が墜ちてからは
いまいち張り合いが無くてな――","I used to be involved in the defense of Fort Gritten, but since that Mogok guy went down, I haven't had the same level of excitement--the competition has really been lacking."
"ここのエリアマスター就任の打診を受けた時は
これぞ、と思ったものだ！","When I received the offer to become an Area Master here, I thought, ""This is it!"""
"見ての通り、この駐屯地は臨時のものだ
だが、調査のために必要なものについては
それなりの質のものを集めている","As you can see, this base is temporary but we have gathered the necessary equipment for the investigation."
"質だけじゃなく、数もきっちり揃えてあるぞ！
お前の部下たちにも遠慮なく使うよう
言っておいてくれ","Not only the quantity, but also the quality is meticulous! Please tell your subordinates to use it without hesitation."
"おう、来たな！
あらためて自己紹介しておこうか
魔赤島調査隊、隊長のベルトランだ
この島のエリアマスターも兼任している","Oh, you've arrived! Let me introduce myself again. I'm Bertrand, the captain of the Bloodbane Isle research team. I'm also the Area Master of this island."
"エリアマスターとは言っても
こんな状況だ
まだ何一つわからんがな！
まずは拠点を一通り設営したところだ","Even though I say I'm an Area Master, the situation is like this. I still don't understand anything! First, I have to set up the base."
"――そう不安そうな顔をするな！
島の全体像を早期に探るべく
身軽な人員を俺直属の斥候隊として
連れてきたから安心してくれ！","Don't look so worried! I've brought a team of agile individuals as my direct reconnaissance unit to swiftly explore the entire island. So, rest assured!"
"彼らにはなるべく戦闘を避けさせ
島の地形や魔物の生息状況を
重点的に探らせていく予定だ","We'll have them avoid combat as much as possible,
and focus on exploring the island's terrain and demonic inhabitants."
"そして、斥候隊を始めとする
各部隊からの情報を統括したり
調査の方向性を監督するのが俺の仕事ってわけだ","And so, my job involves overseeing information from various units, including the scout team, and supervising the direction of the investigation."
"監督といっても
お前たちはそれぞれの判断で
調査を進めてくれて構わん！
ジョゼフ様直々のお達しだ","Speaking of the overseer, 
each of you can proceed with the investigation
based on your own judgment!
This is a direct order from Joseph himself."
"俺もこの拠点で大人しくしているつもりは無いぞ！
この未知の状況、己の実力を計るには
絶好のチャンスだ！　腕が鳴るな！","I don't intend to sit still at this base either! In this unknown situation, it's the perfect opportunity to test my abilities. I'm itching to go!"
"調査の進捗はどうだ？
支援品を割り当てておいたから
持っていくといい
今後の働きに期待してるぞ！","How is the progress of the investigation? I have allocated support items, so it would be good to bring them along. I am expecting great work from you in the future!"
"調査の成果が出始めているな
厳しい状況に変わりはないが
この調子で進めていこう","The results of the investigation are beginning to show,
but the situation remains severe.
Let's continue in this way."
"お前の隊もいつも頑張ってくれている
支援品を少し大目に持っていくといい
今後も期待してるぞ！","Your squad always does a great job, too.
You can take a little extra support supplies with you!
I'm looking forward to seeing more of you in the future!"
"ふむ、この調査隊の中でも
ずば抜けた動きをしているのが
お前の隊だろう！
さすがはジョゼフ様のお墨付きだ！","Hmmm, of all these survey teams, the one that stands out from the rest is yours!
That's what I'm talking about, Masters Joseph's endorsement!"
"走り回ればそれだけ消耗もしているだろう
支援品の割り当てを増やしておくから
遠慮せずに持っていってくれ","If you keep running around, you'll exhaust yourself even more. 
I'll increase the allocation of support items, so please don't hesitate to take them."
"それにしても、拠点にできるような
状態の良い洞窟を早々に発見できたのは
本当に幸運だったな！","Regardless, being able to quickly discover a cave in such a good condition, that could serve as a base was truly fortunate!"
"島の南の方にある洞窟を知っているか？
調査隊内では《不浄の掃き溜め》と
呼んでいる洞窟だ","Do you know about the cave located in the southern part of the island? Within our expedition team, we refer to it as the ""Cesspool of Filth""."
"実はあそこも、この洞窟と同時期に
発見していたんだが
ここと違って、内部が凄まじい状態でな","Actually, we also discovered that place around the same time as this cave.
But unlike here, the interior is in a terrible state."
"何らかの肉食獣が棲みついていたのか
そこら辺に腐った死肉が散乱して――
臭いもそれはひどいもんだった！","Some kind of predator was living in the area.
There was rotting dead meat scattered around--
and the smell was terrible!"
"奥に肉食獣が潜伏しているのを予感して
早期に封鎖しておいたんだが、
お前の実力があれば探索できそうだ","I had a hunch there was a predator lurking in the back,
so I sealed it off early.
I'm sure you could explore it if you're up to it."
"もし臭いが気にならない性質なら
内部を探索しに行ってみてくれ","If it's in your nature to not mind the smell, go and explore the interior."
"そういえば、ここから西に行ったところに
開けた土地があるんだが知っているか？
調査隊では《滝を臨む蝕地》と呼んでいるが――","By the way, do you know that there is an open piece of land if you go west from here? The survey team calls it ""Corrupted Ground Facing the Waterfall""."
"あそこには以前から
侵食ゴブリンどもがうろついていたんだが
最近、数が増えて大きな群れになっているようだ","There have been corruptions, infected goblins wandering around over there for a while, but recently, their number has increased and they seem to have formed a large herd."
"元がゴブリンとはいえ
侵食の作用で凶暴化している上に
数がいると中々厄介だぞ
侮って痛い目を見ないよう気を付けてくれ","Even though they are goblins, they become even more aggressive due to the corrupting effect, and it can be troublesome when there are many of them. Be careful not to underestimate them and suffer the consequences."
"ちょうどいいタイミングで来てくれた！
お前に頼みたいことがあってな","You came just in time!
I have a favor to ask you."
"この拠点から南西の方角の海岸沿いに
古い地下聖堂のような場所が見つかってな
封鎖されていたが、先日ようやく開けることができた","From this base, a place resembling an old underground cathedral was discovered along the southwestern coast. It had been sealed off, but was finally able to be opened the other day."
"中は水が流れていて静かな雰囲気だ――
俺たちは《せせらぎの地下聖堂》と呼んでいる
まぁ、実際に聖堂として使われていたのかは
定かではないが――","Inside, water is flowing, creating a serene atmosphere—
We call it the ""Crypt of Murmurs.""
Well, it's unclear whether it was actually used as a sanctuary—
but it has a holy land-like ambiance."
"この島には珍しく、文化的な造形物が
数多く残されているようだ
あそこを探ることで、何か得るものが
あるんじゃないかと思ってな","Unusually for this island, there seems to be a great number of cultural structures that have been preserved. I believe there may be something to gain by exploring there."
"だが、内部には危険度の高い
魔物が徘徊していて、
相応の戦力を持った者でないと
とても調査は任せられん","However, within, there are highly dangerous enemies wandering around, and unless one possesses sufficient fighting power, I cannot entrust the investigation to them."
"そこで、お前に頼みたいというわけだ
調査に向かうタイミングは任せよう
準備ができたら、また声をかけてくれ！","That's why I'm asking for your help.
I'll leave it to you to decide when to head out to investigate.
When you're ready, give me a call again!"
"各隊員の尽力によって
この島の調査も進みつつあるな！
中でもお前の隊の働きは格別だ！","Thanks to the efforts of each team member,
the investigation of this island is progressing!
Your team's work, in particular, is exceptional!"
"この状況では中々報いてやることもできないが
せめて支援品の割り当てだけでも
増やせるように手配しておこう！","In this situation, it may not be possible to retaliate right away, but let's at least make arrangements to increase the allocation of aid supplies!"
"この島に一つ、塔があるだろう
《聖遺の塔》と呼ばれているあそこだ
あの近くに古い井戸があってな","There should be one tower on this island, it's called the ""Sage Tower Ruins"". There is an old well near there."
"井戸蓋の部分が錆び付いていて
開けられなかったんだが
この間、ようやくこじ開けることができた","The part of the well cover was rusted and couldn't be opened, but recently, I was finally able to pry it open."
"中の探索までは中々手が回っていないが
もしお前の手が空いていたら
覗いてみても損は無いだろう","I haven't gotten around to exploring inside, but if you're available, it wouldn't hurt to take a peek."
"北の方の沿岸に、肉食の魔物が集まりやすい
開けた土地があるのを知っているか？
獲物の死肉が溜め込まれている広場だ","Did you know that there is an open area of land on the northern coast where carnivorous creatures tend to congregate?
It's a square where the carcasses of their prey are stored."
"先日、あの広場に
新手のナイトメアが舞い降りたんだが
隊士を討伐に向かわせてみても、飛び回る上に
歌ったり叫んだりで手に負えんらしい","The other day, a new nightmare landed in that plaza.
I sent a squad to take it down, but they were flying around, singing and screaming and it was too much for them to handle."
"ナイトメアの声には
特殊な魔力が込められているからな
あの辺りに近づく時は注意してくれ","The voice of the Nightmare contains a special kind of magic, so be cautious when getting close to that area."
"そうだ、お前にも話しておこう
この島に来て最初に調査することになった
《侵食魔の巣窟》の奥に
更なる空間が広がっていたのを覚えているか？","That's right, I should tell you too. When I first came to this island, I was assigned to investigate the depths of the ""Infected Den"". Do you remember that there was a further expanse beyond it?"
"予想以上に侵食が進んでいたことから
一旦は俺の判断で封鎖していたんだが
島全体の調査も進んできたことを考えて
そろそろ封鎖を解こうと思ってな","The Corruption had progressed more than anticipated, so I temporarily sealed it off based on my judgment. However, considering that the investigation of the entire island has also progressed, I think it's about time to lift the blockade."
"奥は侵食が進み
特に強力な侵食魔が巣食っていることは
まず間違いないだろう","The depths have been corrupted, and there is no doubt that a powerful infected demon is nesting there."
"調査に入る時は
くれぐれも警戒を怠らないように
抗侵薬の予備も豊富に用意して向かってくれ","When entering the investigation, please be extremely cautious and do not neglect your vigilance. Please also bring ample supplies of Anti-Corruption Medicine with you."
"ちょっとばかりマズい状況になってきてな
“侵食”の進行スピードがこちらの予想を
上回っているようだ――","The situation is becoming a bit troublesome. The speed of Corruption seems to be surpassing our expectations."
"《翼風高原》に
侵食ゴアサイクロプスが現れたんだが
こいつがまた派手に侵食が進んだ個体だ","An ""Infected Goreclops"" has appeared in the Wing Wind Plateau, and this individual's infection has advanced quite dramatically."
"“侵食核”って呼び名らしいが、とにかく頭に
イバラみたいなものを２本も生やしてやがる
あれは体に回りきった毒が
行き場を失って噴きだしたような状態だ","It's called the ""Corruption Core,"" it's got two thorny appendages sticking out of it. It's like the poison in the body has run out of places to go and started to burst out."
"侵食が進んだ魔物は凶暴性が増すのは
前に説明した通りだが
あそこまで侵食が進んでしまうと
もう別種の魔物と考えた方がいいだろうな――","As I explained before, when a monster's corruption advances, its aggressiveness increases. However, when the corruption has progressed to that extent, it might be better to consider it as a different species of creature altogether."
"ともかく、あれは並の隊士に任せるわけにはいかない
かと言って、調査の妨げになる恐れから
放置するのも気がかりだ","Anyway, leaving it to ordinary squad members isn't an option, but at the same time, I'm concerned that it might hinder the investigation."
"頼めるのであれば、お前に討伐を
任せたいんだが――
引き受けてくれるのであれば
あらためて詳細を説明しよう","If it's possible to rely on you, I would like to entrust the subjugation to you...
If you are willing to accept, let me explain the details again."
"お前の隊の目覚ましい働きには
まったく舌を巻くばかりだ！
さすがはレオの後任と期待されるだけあるな！","The remarkable work of your squad is absolutely mind-blowing!
You are indeed the expected successor to Leo!"
"本当はもっときちんと報いてやりたいものだが
この島では手に入るものに限りがあるからな――
その中でも一際良い物が
お前の隊に回るよう手配しよう","I actually want to reward you more properly,
but there are limitations to what can be obtained on this island.
Among those, I will arrange for something particularly good
to be allocated to your squad."
"これからもその調子で調査を進めてくれ
頼りにしているぞ！","Keep up the good work and keep up the research. I'm counting on you!"
"橋を渡ったところに大きな坑道跡があるのは
もう知っているか？","There is a large mine site across the bridge.
Do you already know about it?"
"古い坑道は崩落が怖いからな
安全確保のために今まで封鎖していたが
地盤もそう脆くはないようだから
封鎖を解くことにした","Because there is fear of collapse in the old tunnels,
We have been sealing them off for safety measures.
However, since the ground doesn't seem to be too weak,
We have decided to lift the seal."
"お前には一足先に教えておこう
前人未踏の場所を探索してみたければ
今が絶好の機会だぞ！","Let me tell you in advance;
If you want to explore uncharted territory, now is a great opportunity!"
"西の方に水量の多い洞窟があってな
恐らくあそこが辺り一帯の
水源になってるんだろう","There is a cave with a lot of water to the west. It is likely that it is the source of water in this area."
"中に入ると四方八方から滝の音が聞こえて
方向感覚を失いそうになるくらいだ
調査隊では《滝鳴洞穴》と呼んでいる","Once inside, you can hear the sound of the waterfall from all directions and almost lose your sense of direction. The survey team calls it ""Waterfall Echo Cavern."""
"この島は全体的に水が豊富な印象だが
《滝鳴洞穴》は別格だぞ","I get the impression that water is plentiful on this island as a whole, but Waterfall Echo Cavern is something else!"
"暗い洞窟内で流される危険性や
滝の存在を考慮して封鎖していたが、
お前にはそんな心配は要らんな","We had it sealed off due to the danger of being swept away in the dark cave and the presence of waterfalls, but you don't need to worry about that."
"封鎖を解いておこう
一度行ってみてくれ","Let's lift the blockade;
Please go and see for yourself."
"ふむ――
最近は侵食のペースが以前にも増して
早まっているように思わないか？","Hmm... Don't you think that the rate of corruption has been increasing recently?"
"この間、《菌糸の襲窟》と呼んでいる洞窟の
初期調査が終わったんだが
内部もかなり侵食が進んでいて
そこらへん菌胞だらけになってやがってな","Recently, we finished the initial investigation of a cave known as the ""Fungal Colony Caves,"" but the interior is heavily corrupted. The place is filled with fungal spores."
"斥候に行った隊士も
あらかじめ抗侵薬を飲んでから向かったそうだ","Even the troopers who went scouting took Anti-Corruption Medicine before they went."
"実際はそこまでするほどではないんだが
気持ちはわからんでもない有様だ――","In reality, it might not be as bad as it seems, but I can understand the concern about it."
"当然、侵食魔もウヨウヨしている
お前も《菌糸の襲窟》に向かう時は
抗侵薬を忘れずに持っていくようにな","Of course, the infected creatures are also crawling about. When you head towards the Fungal Colony Caves, make sure to bring the Anti-Corruption Medicine with you."
"ううむ――
いや、少しばかり悩ましい事態になってな","Hmm... Well, it seems that things have become somewhat troubling."
"《菌糸の襲窟》の奥に、侵食ベヘモットが
潜んでいることがわかったんだが
こいつが厄介で――
すでに３人の隊士が負傷して帰ったほどだ","We discovered that a Corrupted Behemoth lurks in the depths of the ""Fungal Colony Caves"", and it's a troublesome one. Three squad members have already returned injured because of it."
"本来であれば俺が向かいたいところだが
ストックしてある医療物資が
底を尽きかけていることもあって、
物資の確保が何よりの急務になってしまった","Normally I would have headed there myself, but
our stock of medical supplies
is running out, and securing supplies
has become a matter of the utmost urgency."
"医療物資の確保も無しに
隊士を討伐に送り出したり、
まして一人討伐に飛び出したとなっては
間違いなくクラリッサに文句を言われるからな――","Sending squad members to face this threat without securing medical supplies, let alone heading out to face it alone, will definitely earn me a scolding from Clarissa."
"そうだ
お前、クラリッサに内緒で
あの侵食ベヘモットを
討伐してきてくれないか？","Yeah. Can you, without letting Clarissa know, go and defeat that Corrupted Behemoth for us?"
"今までも大型の侵食魔を何体も
相手にしてきたお前なら、きっと倒せるはずだ！
こんな大物とやり合う機会もそう無いぞ！
どうだ？　気になったらあらためて声をかけてくれ","You've faced numerous large Corrupted Beasts in the past, and I believe you can defeat it! Opportunities to challenge such a formidable foe are rare. So, what do you say? If you're interested, let me know, and we can discuss it further."
"良いニュースがあるぞ！
調査が進んだことで
レスタニアからの物資を運ぶルートの整備も
ずいぶんと捗ってな！","I have good news! With the progress of the investigation, the maintenance of the route for transporting supplies from Lestania is coming along quite well!"
"今後はより良い支援物資が安定して
送られてくるそうだ
これで、お前の隊も少しは楽になるだろう","They're going to be sending a steady stream of better relief supplies from now on.
This should make things a little easier on your squad."
"それにしても、お前がいなければ
今頃この島の調査もここまでは進んで
いなかっただろう！","Still, without you, we wouldn't have made this much progress in our survey of the island by now!"
"魔赤島調査にかける熱意、そして実力――
どれをとっても抜きんでた働きだ！
今後も期待しているぞ！","The passion and skills dedicated to the investigation of Bloodbane Isle are exceptional! We are expecting great things in the future!"
