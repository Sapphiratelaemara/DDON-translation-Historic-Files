old,
うん、何か用かな？,"Hmm, what can I do for you?"
"川を少し北にいったところの河原
《血すすぎ河原》っていうんだが
いつのころからかリザードマンが集まってきてなぁ","A little north of the river, there's a riverbed
called the ""Blood Rinsing Riverbed""
Lizardmen have been gathering there for some time now."
"川を泳いでこっちへ来やしないかと
落ち着かんね","I'm wondering if he's going to swim down the river and come over here.
I'm getting restless."
"覚者さん、よければそこの黒ブドウ亭
にいるアルフレドに力を貸してやって
くれないか","Arisen, if you don't mind, can you help Alfredo at the Black Grape Pavilion there

"
はぁ、疲れが溜まりやすくなったな,"Ah, I've been getting tired easily."
"やや熱っぽいような気が
い、いやいや気のせいだな","I feel somewhat feverish
No, no, no, it's just my imagination."
"西側の森に、巨大な何かが落ちてきたんだ
神殿から調査の人も来ていたよ
村の者は恐ろしくて誰も近寄らんね","Something huge fell in the woods to the west.
Some people from the temple came to investigate.
No one in the village is afraid to go near it."
