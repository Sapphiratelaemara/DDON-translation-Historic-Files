さ、どうする？","You're finally here; the Arisen who received the protection of the white wings. So, what will you do?"
"ここまでお疲れ様！
だけど、あなたたちはもっともっと先に
進まないといけない――","Good job so far!
But you guys need to go on much, much further--"
"もうわかってるわよね？
私がここの土砂を片付けてあげるから
そのための力を集めてきてちょうだい","You already know that, don't you?
I'll clean up the sediment here for you.
Go gather the strength to do so."

"――こういうの、本当は
よその国の人に任せるべきじゃないと
思うんだけどさ","I really don't think that this kind of thing should be left to people from other countries."
"だけど、今戦うことができる覚者は
あなたしかいない――
だから、頼んだわね","But, the only one who can fight now is the Arisen――

this country."

もうこの先に行ってるみたいよ","Hmm, it seems like your friends
have already moved on ahead."
"お友達の力をたどって、一時的に
あなたもこの先へ行けるけど
どうする？","Following the power of your friends, you can temporarily go this way, but, what will you do?"
"通常開拓する","Explore normally."
"仲間の力をたどる","Follow the power of your companion"
"私がまたアッカーシェランのために働くのは
もっともっと、ずっと遠い未来のことかと思ってた","I thought that working for Acre Selund again would be something for a much, much more distant future."

"自分の命はなくなっても
国っていうのは未来永劫続くような気がしてたの","Even if my life were to disappear,

こんな姿になった時にしか目覚めないなんて
ちょっと損な気もするわ","When our beloved Acre Selund has become like this, and only awakens in such a state, it feels like a bit of a loss."

見たかったのに","I would have liked to have seen a more--
gloriously prosperous Acre Selund."
"アデライデ様の頃のアッカーシェランは
それは活気に満ち溢れた美しい国だったの","During the time of Lady Adelaide, Acre Selund was a vibrant and beautiful country overflowing with energy."

この国の未来は明るく素敵なことばかりって
そう信じて、疑うこともなかったわ","I couldn't stay by your side for long, but I believed in a bright and wonderful future for this country, and I never doubted it."
