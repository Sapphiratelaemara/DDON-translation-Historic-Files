"old",""
"いやぁ、なかなかうまくいかねぇぜ
目当ての品を探すにも、収穫ナシの日が
続くと酒がまずくならぁ","Well, it's not going so well.
Even if you're looking for something you're looking for, a day without a harvest
can make your drink go bad..."
"ハーピーの野郎――いや、女ども！
頭の上をギャーギャー飛びまわって
うるさくてかなわねぇや","Harpy's - no, women!
They're flying around on my head
making so much noise!"
"登ってる時に限って襲って
きやがるしよぉ！","They attack me only when I'm climbing
!"
"たまーに渓谷で、でかい魔物を見かけるんだよな
さすがに避けて通るが、ぶっ倒したら
見返りもでかそうだよな","Sometimes in the canyon, I see a big demon.
I avoid it, as I should, but if I knock it down,
the payback seems to be huge too."
"とはいえ、命あっての物種っつーしな","However, life is what we make of it."
"おう！　何か用か","Oh!　What do you want?"
"《ドリード監視塔》は知ってっか？
何十年か前、白騎団の駐屯所だったらしいが
完全な廃墟だぜ","Do you know about the Dreed Watchtower? It seems like it used to be the barracks of the White Knights several decades ago, but now it's just a complete ruin."
"ま、それなりに使えるものは残ってそう
だけどな
あの野郎――いや、ギャーギャー喚く
鳥女どもが邪魔しやがるが！","Well, it looks like there's still some usable
stuff left
but that bastard - no, the gawking
bird women are getting in the way!"
