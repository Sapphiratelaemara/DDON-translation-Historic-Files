"何の用で来たんダ？
貢ぎ物か？　それなら――あぁ――うム
話、聞いてやらんでもない","What brings you here?
A tribute, perhaps? Well then, ah... I suppose I wouldn't mind hearing your story.",,Gilstan
"あぁ――まったく――！
人、特に覚者ってヤツはいつもいつも――
ゴブリンと見るや剣を振りおって、あぁ忌々しイ！","Ah―― Good grief――!
People, especially the Arisen, are always――
Swinging their swords at Goblins, yes, how annoying!",,Gilstan
"だが、取り引きなら――悪くなイ
剣を向けるなら、外の魔物にするんだナ
で、とっとと出てってくれ","But if you're looking for a deal - not a bad one.
If you're going to point a sword at me, do it at the demon outside.
And get the hell out of here.",,Gilstan
"ここは我ガ城、収集の園
外の愚かなゴブリン、魔物にこの価値は
わからない――ダろ","This is our castle, the garden of collection.
The foolish goblins outside do not understand the value of this place, to the enemies of magic.",,Gilstan
"だけど――なぁ――人、覚者
お前、アレの価値はわかるナ？
なら交換、交換ダ
価値ある物とナ","However... hey... people, Arisen.
Do you understand the value of that thing?
If so, let's exchange, exchange.
With something of value.",,Gilstan
"おまえ、覚えてるぞ！
魔物やっつけにきたか？
ゴブリンやっつけにきたか？","I remember, you know!
Did you come to defeat the monsters?
Did you come to defeat the goblins?",,Gilstan
"面倒だから仲良くしような
あれこれ、良くしてやるヨ","It's a hassle, so let's be friends.
This and that, I'll make it better.",,Gilstan
