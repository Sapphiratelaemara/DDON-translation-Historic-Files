"old","new"
"おお、泊っていくのか、だったら
<VAL PRICE_INN>だ
――だが、こんな場所だから大したもてなしは
期待しないでくれよ、それでもいいか？","Oh, you're planning to stay here? In that case, it will be <VAL PRICE_INN>.
However, don't expect much hospitality in a place like this. Is that still okay?"
"はい","Yes"
"いいえ","No"
"ああ、《弱化の治療》なら
<VAL PRICE_WEAK>だよ
――言い訳ではないが
足元を見ているわけじゃないんだよ","Ah, if it's ""Treat Weakness,"" it costs <VAL PRICE_WEAK>, you know.
It's not an excuse, but I'm not looking down on you."
"はい","Yes"
"いいえ","No"
"君は《弱化》にはなっていないようだ
――うむ、よかったじゃないか
弱ってるのは気のせいだよ","It seems that you haven't weakened after all.
Well, that's good, isn't it?
You're just imagining that you're weak."
"――おぉ、これは旅の方、用件を伺うよ","-Oh, travelers, I have come to inquire about your purpose here."
"はあぁぁ――、日々ぎりぎりの生活だ
１日５回は溜息がでる
今までなんとか持ちこたえているが","Ohhh... I live on the edge every day.
I let out a sigh at least five times a day.
I've managed to hang on until now, but..."
"だが、わたしは移住はしたくないんだよ
だってこんな村でも、たった一つの
故郷だものなぁ――","But, I don't want to move.
Because even in a village like this, it's my one and only home."
"オークにやられきり、村を全部廃墟になんか
させたくないものなぁ――","I don't want the village to become a complete ruin, destroyed by Orcs."
"ゆっくりしていくといい
といっても、我々ができることは知れているがね
ふうぅ――","It would be good to take it easy.
That being said, there are things we know we can do.
Phew--"
"はぁぁ――サニーにも苦労をかけてばかりだなぁ","Sunny, I always seem to be causing you trouble, huh?"
"どうか、手が空いてればいいんだが
あれの仕事も手伝ってやってくれないだろうか","I hope you're not too busy, but could you possibly help me with that task?"
"家畜や集落を守るのも、今はゴート頼みだ
我々を助けると思って、一匹でもオークを
減らしていってくれるとありがたい","To protect livestock and settlements, we now rely on Gort. 
It would be appreciated if you could help us could help us by reducing the Orcs numbers even by one."
"本当、どうか一つ頼むよ
これ以上豚がやられたら
我々がワラを喰うはめに――
はぁああああ――","Please, I beg of you.
If any more pigs are harmed, we will be forced to eat straw---
Haaaahhh---"
"ああ、泊っていくのか、そうか！
料金なんてもちろん不要さ！
――はぁああ、本当ならもっともてなしをしたい所
なのに、何もない村ですまないなぁ","Ah, are you going to stay overnight? I see!
Of course, the fee is not necessary!
Ah, if only I could entertain you more, but in this village, there is nothing, I'm sorry."
"はい","Yes"
"いいえ","No"
