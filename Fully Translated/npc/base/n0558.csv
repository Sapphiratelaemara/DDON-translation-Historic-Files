空気も清浄で――","Here; Elan Water Grove is a beautiful place, right? The air is also clean――"
"やっぱり水が多いからなのかしら？
ね、船の上で深呼吸してみて
きっと気持ちがいいわ","Is it because there is a lot of water after all? Well, try taking a deep breath on the boat. It will surely feel good."

結構力仕事なのよねぇ","Ugh, I'm starting to get hungry... It's quite a physically demanding job, you know."
