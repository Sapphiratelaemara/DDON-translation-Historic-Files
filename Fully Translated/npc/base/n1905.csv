"old",""
"いやー、参った参った
まさかお前がここまで凄いとはなぁ――
副隊長がベタ褒めするのもしょうがないか","Well, I'm impressed, I'm impressed. 
I didn't expect you to be this amazing. 
I guess even the vice-captain's over-the-top praise is understandable."
"正直、お前がいなかったらこの砦は
オークに落とされてたかもしれん
俺も他のヤツも、それは解ってるツモリさ","Honestly, if you weren't here, this fortress might have been taken down by Orcs. 
Both me and the others know that."
"さ、今度の特別報償だ
胸を張って受け取れよ！","Well, this time it's a special reward, so accept it with pride!"
"よぉよぉ！！　ブイブイ言わせてる
みたいじゃないか
新入りだと思ってたらあっという間だな","Hey, hey! 
You're really making waves, aren't you? 
I thought you were a newcomer, but time flies."
"お前の働きに対して、報償が出たぞ
ま、それだけ戦果をあげたってわけだ
誇っていいぞ、うん","You've been rewarded for your work.
Well, that's what you get for fighting the good fight.
You should be proud, yeah."
"おおそうだ！
お前の働きぶり、ちょくちょく聞いてるぞ
これからも頑張れよ！","Oh yeah!
I've heard a lot about your work, Keep it up!"
"お前、すごい活躍なんだってな！
ちくしょー、さっき副隊長が
わざわざこれをお前にってよ","I heard you've been doing amazing work! 
Hell, just now the vice-captain specifically gave this to you."
"ほら、持ってけ！
あーちくしょ～！　羨ましい！！","Here, take it!
Ah, damn it~!　I'm so jealous!"
"おうおう、頑張ってるみたいじゃないか！
お前には他のヤツよりちょっといい
支給品を回してやるよ","Oh, well, it looks like you're doing a great job!
I'm going to give you a little better allowance than the rest of them."
"お疲れさん、忘れず顔を出したな
ほれ、今回の支給品だ","Good job, you didn't forget to show up.
Here, here's the latest supply."
"よぉ！
よく来たな、噂の大型新人！","Hey there!
You've come at a good time, the rumored big shot rookie!"
"俺は砦北部のエリア、バートランド平原の
エリアマスターをしてるスケルツォ
――お前と同じ覚者だ","I am Scherzo, the Area Master of the northern area, Betland Plains. I am an Arisen, just like you."
"しかし困ったぞ――
憧れのヴァネッサ副隊長が信頼するレオ統率に
目をかけられてるお前――！","However, I'm in trouble--
You, who are being noticed by Leo, the commanding officer whom Lieutenant Vanessa admires and trusts!"
"俺にとっちゃあ、最大のライバル出現だ！","For me, this is the biggest rivalry I've ever had!"
"――とまぁ、冗談はさておきよろしくな！","-- and well, joking aside, nice to meet you!"
"ここのクエストボードは正門の中だ
バートランド平原の任務――
資源確保とオーク軍の勢力調査だ","The quest board here is inside the main gate.
Quests in the Betland Plains - securing resources and investigating the Orc army's strength."
"そのうちお前にも頼むことになるだろうが
今すぐにってわけじゃない
なにせ危険地帯だからな","I'll have to ask you to do it eventually.
Not right now, though.
It's a dangerous zone, after all."
"まずは、レオ統率や他のエリアマスター
から一目置かれる覚者になってくれよ
――あ、でも副隊長の前では控えめにな！","First, become an Arisen who is respected by Leo and other Area Masters. 
But, be modest in front of the Vice Captain!"
"お前の働きぶり、ちょくちょく聞いてるぞ
これからも頑張れよ！","I've heard a lot about your work,
keep up the good work!"
"ま、俺がお前のために直接してやれることは
支給くらいだけど
成果に応じていいもん手配してやるからさ！","Well, the only direct thing I can do for you is to provide support, but I'll arrange something nice for you based on your results, so...!"
"一つ、不穏な情報が入ってるんだ","There is one piece of unsettling information."
"バートランド高地の監視塔近く、湖のほとり
《湖岸の廃墟》でコロッサスが出現するように
なったようでな
それもかなりの剛腕ぶりらしい","Near the observation tower in Betland Highlands, by the lake. 
A Colossus seems to have appeared at the Lakeside Ruins. 
And it seems to possess quite an impressive level of strength."
"あそこはバートランド連絡路にも近いから
周囲を通る時は気をつけろ
もちろん、討伐してくれりゃ大助かりだ","Because there is a connecting channel to Betland nearby, be careful when passing through there. 
Of course, it would be a great help if you could subdue it."
"おっ！　そうだ
お前に頼みたい任務があるんだ","Oh! That's right.
I have a mission that I want to ask of you."
"《バートランド墓地》は知ってるか？
まぁ簡単に言えば、任務はその内部調査だ","Do you know about Betland Cemetery? Well, to put it simply, the mission is to investigate its interior."
"中の様子を見てみて
もし魔物がいたらその討伐！
――うんまぁ、あれだ、シンプルだろ？","Take a look inside and if there are demons, then defeat them!
--Yeah well, that's it, simple, right?"
"任務を受ける準備ができたら
あらためて声を掛けてくれ","When you're ready to take on the assignment, give me a call again."
"よぉよぉ！！　ブイブイ言わせてる
みたいじゃないか
新入りだと思ってたらあっという間だな","Hey, hey! 
You're really making waves, aren't you? 
I thought you were a newcomer, but time flies."
"お前の働きに対して、報償が出たぞ
支給品の格上げだ","I have received compensation for your labor.
It is an upgrade of the supplies provided."
"ま、それだけ戦果をあげたってわけだ
誇っていいぞ、うん","Well, that's how much you've accomplished in the war.
You can be proud of yourself, yeah."
"要警戒情報が入ったぞ！
オークの本拠地に近い、平原北部――
《バートランド大橋》のたもとで、精鋭部隊らしき
オークの一団が目撃されたんだ","Alert! We have received important information.
In the northern part of the plain, near the Orc stronghold, underneath Betland Bridge, a group of elite Orcs has been sighted."
"部隊が準備をしている間に
何とかしないと、また砦が攻め込まれない
とも限らない","While the unit is preparing, we must do something, or the fortress may be breached again.
There is no guarantee otherwise."
"ヴァネッサ副隊長には報告済みだが
もし対処できそうなら、お前の方でも
よろしく頼む","I have already reported it to Vice Captain Vanessa, but if you think you can address it, I also ask for your assistance."
"バートランドのどこかには
モゴックの腹心《戦鬼ゲソム》が指揮する
部隊のアジトがあるって情報も入ってる","Somewhere in Betland, there is information that Gesomu the War Demon, Mogok's right-hand man, commands a base for his unit."
"引き続き調べる必要があるな","I'll have to keep looking into this."
"おお！　お前に連絡だ！
ついに奴らの本拠地、《バートランド平原北部》に
攻め込む手はずが整ったぞ","Oh! I've got news for you!
We have finally made arrangements to invade their stronghold, the Northern Betland Plains."
"バートランド北部へと繋がる
山道を塞いでいた落石を、ようやく除去できたんだ","We were finally able to remove the rocks that were blocking the mountain road that leads to northern Betland."
"ま、そこが通れるようになったのはお互い様で
これでオークどもも、魔獣を使って山側から
侵入する必要なく、そのままこっちへ来れる
ようになったわけだが――","Well, we both made it possible to pass through there. 
Now those orcs can come over here without needing to invade from the mountain side using magic beasts."
"ともあれ、隊を組んで奴らの居城
《ガルドノック砦》に乗り込む日も近いだろうな！","Regardless, the day is approaching when we will go together and infiltrate their stronghold, Gardnox Fortress!"
"よう、砦の任務は順調かい？","Hey, how's the mission at the fortress going?"
"そ、そうだ！！
良い所にきたな、お前にも言っておこう！
《禊の神殿》について新しい情報が入ってな","Oh, right!! 
You've come to a good place, so I'll tell you too! 
There's new information about the Temple of Purification."
"神殿内部に、ずっと入れなかった
《不浄の地下水路》って区画があるんだ
もとは神殿に引いた湖の水を浄化する
区画だったんだが――","Inside the temple, there is a section called the ""Foul Water Channel"" that I have never been able to enter. 
It used to be a section for purifying the water from the lake that was drawn into the temple."
"昔のエリアマスター、禊の神官長が
封鎖して立入禁止にしたんだよ
何があったか知らないけどな","The former area master, the priest in charge of purification, blocked off the area and prohibited entry. 
I don't know what happened though."
"それがごく最近、その封鎖が
解けているのが発見されたんだ","Very recently, that blockade was found to have been broken."
"それに気づいた定期討伐の隊士は
妙な威圧感と寒気に襲われて
結局中まで入れなかったらしい","The squad members who noticed it were ultimately unable to enter due to a strange sense of intimidation and coldness."
"もしついでがあったら、確認しといてくれよ
オークはともかく、俺はこの手の話
苦手なんだよな――","If you happen to have some time, please check it for me.
As for orcs, I'm not really good with that kind of thing you know."
"厳重警戒情報だ！
セラー湖の浜辺、《船墓場》で妙に強力な
ブルーニュートが現れたらしい","This is a serious warning!
It seems that a strangely powerful Blue Newt has appeared on the shore of Lake Cera, known as the ""Ship Graveyard""."
"普通のヤツと区別して《レイクニュート》
と呼ぶことにしたんだが、どうやら
脅威はそれだけじゃないようでな","I decided to call it ""Lake Newt"" to distinguish it from a regular one, but it seems that the threat is not just that."
"ヤツらのいる付近で、巨大な影と水面を
横切るヒレを見たって隊士もいるんだ","Near where they are, there are some members of the squad who have seen a giant shadow and a fin cutting through the water's surface."
"セラー湖の怪物――
ヒレ以外の情報はなく、その報告をうけ
確認に行った奴も正体を掴んでいない","The Monster of Lake Cera-- 

Aside from its fins, there is no other information, and even those who went to confirm it have not grasped its true nature."
"お前も十分注意しろよ
相当強力な魔物がいるに違いない","You be very careful too.
There must be some pretty powerful demons in there."
"いやー、参った参った
まさかお前がここまですごいとはなぁ――
副隊長がベタ褒めするのもしょうがないか","Well, I'm impressed, I'm impressed. I didn't expect you to be this amazing. 
I guess even the Vice-Captain's over-the-top praise is understandable."
"正直、お前がいなかったらこの砦は
オークに落とされてたかもしれん
俺も他のヤツも、それは解ってるツモリさ","Honestly, if you weren't here, this fortress might have been taken down by Orcs. 
Both me and the others know that."
"さ、今度の特別報償だ
特級の支給を受けられるようしておいたぞ
胸を張って受け取れよ！","Well, this time it's a special reward.
I made sure you can receive a first-class payment.
Receive it with pride!"
"これからもよろしくな！","Thank you for your continued support!"
"お前に頼みたい任務があるんだ
今回は、特に重要な任務だ","I have a mission I need you to do for me.
It's a particularly important mission this time."
"もしかしたら、ついに奴らオークの拠点
モゴックの腹心が潜んでいるらしい
《戦鬼の影穴》を潰せるかもしれん","Maybe we can finally destroy the Orc stronghold where they say Mogok's henchmen lurk, ""War Demons' Hideout""."
"すでに別の隊士が怪しい場所を
調べにいってるんだが、まだ戻らない
もしかしたら感づかれて
すでに殺されている可能性もある","Another soldier has already gone to investigate a suspicious location, but they haven't returned yet. 
However, they might have been noticed and possibly killed already."
"そこで、お前にも危険を覚悟で
二次調査をしてもらいたいんだ","Therefore, I would like you to conduct a secondary investigation, being prepared for danger."
"この調査、なるはやで頼めないか？
準備ができたらまた声を掛けてくれ","Can you ask for this survey as soon as possible?
Call me again when you're ready."
"俺は砦の庶務全般を担当してる
ま、要するに副隊長の小間使いだよ","I'm in charge of all the general affairs of the fort.
Well, in short, I'm the deputy commander's lackey."
"体を鍛えて鍛えて、鍛えまくって！！
そのうち副隊長を振り向かせてやるのさ！","I'm going to work out, work out, work out!
One of these days I'm going to turn the vice captain around!"
"あ、とるなよ！　それ俺のだから！","Ah, don't take that! It's mine!"
"砦内の《クエストボード》にはな
調査や討伐以外に、ちょいちょい
副隊長じきじきの依頼があってな――","On the ""Quest Board"" inside the fortress, there are not only investigations and subjugations, but also occasional requests directly from the vice captain."
"そういえば、《辺境の礎》ってあるだろ？
アレ、基本的には覚者本人が触れないと
使えるようにならないんだがな","By the way, aren't there Sub Portcrystals? 
In general, they can't be used unless the Arisen themselves touch them."
"ここら辺一帯でのお前の働きを評価して
バートランド平原にある《辺境の礎》全部が
使えるようにされたそうだ","I heard that your efforts in this area have been evaluated, and now all of the Sub Portcrystals in the Betland Plains have been made available."
"いや～、最近のお前の活躍っぷりは
すごかったからな！","No~, your recent successes have been
amazing!"
"ま、今回の《辺境の礎》の解放は
俺じゃなくて神殿のハカライってことになるんだが
俺もお前の実力はちゃーんと認めてるからな！","Well, the release of the ""Sub Portcrystals"" this time will be done by the Temple's official, not me.
But I also acknowledge your abilities properly, you know!"
"これからもブイブイ言わせてるお前を
楽しみにしてるぞ！","I'm looking forward to seeing you continue to thrive!"
"よぉ、元気か？
ちょうどお前に頼みたいことがあったんだ","Hey, how you doing?
I just had a favor to ask you."
"バートランド大橋の近くに
《薄煙の荒れ地》って呼ばれてる場所があるんだがな","There is a place near Betland Bridge called the ""Wispy Wasteland""."
"あそこは元からオークが
出没しやすいところだったんだが
最近、血の臭いに引き寄せられたのか
ガーゴイルまで飛び回り始めたんだ","That place has always been an easy spot for Orcs to appear.
Lately, they must have been attracted by the smell of blood, as Gargoyles have started flying around too."
"知っての通り、やつら飛び回りながら
石化の呪いを吐きつけてくるだろ？
あれが思ったより厄介でなぁ","As you know, those guys are flying around and spitting out a curse of petrification, right?
That curse is more troublesome than I thought."
"というわけで駆除を頼みたい
準備ができたら、また声をかけてくれ","So, I would like to request extermination services.
When you are ready, please let me know."
"よ、よぉ――
え？　顔色が悪いって？","Yo, yo--
Huh? My complexion looks bad?"
"ちょっと気味の悪い話を聞いてな――
本当は聞きたくなかったんだが
エリアマスターとしてこの地域の情報は
全て把握しておかないといけないし――","Let me tell you a slightly eerie story――
I really didn't want to hear it, but as an Area Master, I must know all the information about this area."
"ええい、道連れだ！
お前も聞いていけ！","Very well, come along!
You too, listen and go!"
"《罪人の修獄》って知ってるか？
あそこは獄死した罪人ばかりが
埋葬されていた地下墓場でな","Do you know about the Penitentiary for Sinners? It's an underground cemetery where only sinners who died in prison are buried."
"かなり前に使われなくなって閉鎖されたんだが
最近、いつの間にか鍵が――
開いてたそうだ――","It had been quite a while since it was last used and closed down, but recently, seemingly out of nowhere, the lock had been――
open――"
"いやぁ、俺はこの手の話は苦手なんだよ
獣やオークなら、俺の鍛えた筋肉と技で
何とかなるが
幽霊はそういう問題じゃないからな――","Well, I'm not good with this kind of talk. 
If it's about animals or orcs, I can handle it with my trained muscles and skills. 
But ghosts are a different problem, you know."
"いいところに来てくれた！
人並み外れた度胸のある覚者
そう、正にお前を待ってたんだ！","You've come to a good place!
An Arisen with extraordinary courage!
Yes, I've been waiting just for you!"
"この前話しただろう
《罪人の修獄》の鍵が
いつの間にか開いてたって件でな","We talked about it before, right?
Regarding the lock to ""Penitentiary,"" it seems it was somehow opened."
"ほっとくわけにはいかないから
調査のために何人か人をやってみたんだ","Because I can't just let it be, I tried assigning some people for the investigation."
"そうしたら、案の定というか何というか
――出たんだとさ――
女の笑う声があちこちから聞こえてきたらしい","Well, as expected, or rather, just as I thought—
―― There it is ――
The sound of a woman's laughter seemed to be coming from various directions."
"おれはそういうのはどうも苦手でな
こうなると、頼れるのはお前しかいない！
確かああいう類もイケるんだったよな？","I'm not very good at that kind of thing.
In this situation, the only one I can rely on is you!
I'm pretty sure that kind of thing is possible too, right?"
"今すぐに行ってくれとは言わない！
いや、言えない――
覚悟ができたら、あらためて声をかけてくれ","I'm not asking you to go now!
No, I can't tell you--
When you're ready, call on me again."
"よぉよぉ！
お前の最近の活躍っぷりときたら
寝てても噂が耳飛び込んでくるくらいだぞ！","Hey hey!
Your recent achievements, I've been hearing about them even when I'm sleeping!
You're making quite a buzz, aren't you!"
"今までのお前の働きが評価されて
報酬が更に良い物になったから
楽しみにしておいてくれ！","Your previous efforts have been recognized, and as a result, your rewards have become even better. 
Please look forward to it!"
"共にこのグリッテン砦を、そして神殿を支えていこう
これからもよろしくな！","Let us support Fort Gritten and the Temple together. 
So, let us continue to work together from now on."
