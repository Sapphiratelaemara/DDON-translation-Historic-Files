全ての訪問者を歓迎しますぞ！","Welcome! The Zoma Inn welcomes all visitors."

"そもそもこのゾマは、かつての大都市メルゴダ
の周辺部にあたる町でしてな
それはそれは多くの人で栄えたのだとか","Zoma is a town on the periphery of Mergoda, a former metropolis that flourished with a large number of people."

長らく打ち捨てられておったのですが
オークから逃げた人が各地から流れ
遺跡に隠れ住むようになったのですな","From the time when Mergoda fell and people gathered to the south, it was abandoned for a long time, but people who escaped from the Orcs flowed in from various places and began to live hidden in the ruins."

メルゴダでは盛んに研究されてましてな","A technique now forbidden, called alchemy, is being actively studied in Mergoda."
"変な金属が埋め込まれた魔物達は
その時に兵隊として使われていた、
いわばメルゴダ民の使い魔なのだとか","The monsters embedded with strange metal were reportedly used as soldiers at that time. 
So to speak, they were the Mergoda people's familiars."
"それも、元の生き物より格段に強く
改造されていたと言います","And they say that it was significantly stronger than the original creature after being modified."
"いやぁ、魔物を意のままに操りそれを
使役するなど、恐ろしくもあり素晴らしくもある！
驚きですな！","Oh, controlling monsters at will and using them as your own... It's both terrifying and amazing! Truly astonishing!"
"おおお、結構結構！！
じっくり飲んで休んで英気を養って下され！
宿代はあなたの活躍で十分ですぞ","Oh, oh, quite good, quite good!!
Take your time to drink and rest, and regain your heroic spirit!
The lodging fee is more than enough with your outstanding performance."
