"うむ、何か言ったか？","Mm, what did you say?"
"うむ――どうすればオリバー殿は
私の弟子入りを認めて下さるのか","Hmm... How can I make Lord Oliver accept me as his disciple?"

《呪詛の庭》に現れるという闇の使いを
倒すことができれば――あるいは――","For example, if you manage to defeat the darkness envoy that appears in the ""Garden of Curses,"" a place with terrifying rumors, then - perhaps - you will be able to..."
"いやしかし、それだけの腕がすでにあるなら
そもそも弟子入りの必要はないような――
うむ――悩ましいな","However, if you already have such skills, there might be no need to become a disciple---

落ち着いて食事もできない","Being constantly approached and unable to have a peaceful meal."
"私はこれでも一介の剣士
墓荒らしではない
剣の技を求めてここへ来た","I am just a swordsman, not a grave robber.
I came here in search of swordsmanship."

ここに滞在し己の技を磨こうと思う","I'm going to stay here and hone my craft until he approves."
