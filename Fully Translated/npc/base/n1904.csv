"old",""
"やぁ、お疲れさん","Hey, you must be tired."
"バートランド平原には
いくつか要注意ポイントがあるんだ","There are several points of interest in the Bertrand Plain:"
"まずはセラー湖近くの《湖岸の廃墟》
大型の魔物がなぜか現れやすいんだ","First, the ""Lakeside Ruins"" near Lake Cera.
Large enemies tend to appear for some reason."
"あとは、平原西はずれの《バートランド大橋》だね
こっちはよほどの偵察でもなけりゃ
行かないだろうけど
オークの部隊が巡回していることがあるんだ","Next, there's the Betland Bridge on the western edge of the plain, right?
Unless you're on a serious reconnaissance mission, you probably won't go there, but there are times when Orc units patrol the area."
"湖の浜辺あたりも
水棲竜の目撃情報があったりして物騒だよね
まぁ、結局どこもわりと危険なんだけど","Even the beach around the lake has reports of sightings of aquatic dragons, making it dangerous.
Well, in the end, everywhere is relatively dangerous."
"とほほ、ブーツの紐が切れちゃったよ
縁起悪いよなぁ","And ohoho, my boot laces broke.
That's not a good omen, is it?"
"オークの臭いがもうちょっとマシだったらなぁ","If only the smell of the Orc was a little less repugnant..."
"まぁでも、そんな愚痴を言ってられるのも
生きてるからだよなぁ","Well, but I'm only able to complain about that because I'm alive."
"知ってるか？　ヴァネッサ副隊長も
前は色々大変だったそうだ","Did you know? Vice Captain Vanessa also went through a lot before."
"女で覚者で、騎士団からの風当たりも
強かったりでな","As a woman and an Arisen, the criticism from the Knight's Order can be strong."
"ま、だからこそあんな凛々しくカッコよく
へへへ――
なれたんだろうなぁ","Well, that's why she was able to become so noble and cool.
Hehehe--"
